print your name on the screen your name on the screen your name on the screen now to run this go on the top now to run this go on the top now to run this go on the top under the run menu click run also note under the run menu click run also note under the run menu click run also note that there is a shortcut associated with that there is a shortcut associated with that there is a shortcut associated with this command when i program i always use this command when i program i always use this command when i program i always use shortcuts because that increases my shortcuts because that increases my shortcuts because that increases my productivity so here on a mac computer productivity so here on a mac computer productivity so here on a mac computer the shortcut is control option and r on the shortcut is control option and r on the shortcut is control option and r on windows is different so let's go ahead windows is different so let's go ahead windows is different so let's go ahead with that now it's asking where you want with that now it's asking where you want with that now it's asking where you want to run this click on app to run this click on app to run this click on app now down below now down below now down below you should see this little terminal you should see this little terminal you should see this little terminal window this is like a little window into window this is like a little window into window this is like a little window into our program so here we can see the our program so here we can see the our program so here we can see the results or output of our program in the results or output of our program in the results or output of our program in the future as you learn more python you'll future as you learn more python you'll future as you learn more python you'll be able to build applications that have be able to build applications that have be able to build applications that have a graphical user interface or gui that a graphical user interface or gui that a graphical user interface or gui that is a little bit complicated so for now is a little bit complicated so for now is a little bit complicated so for now we're going to use this little terminal we're going to use this little terminal we're going to use this little terminal window to see the results of our program window to see the results of our program window to see the results of our program so as you can see my name is printed so as you can see my name is printed so as you can see my name is printed here now as you write code this window here now as you write code this window here now as you write code this window might get in the way so you can always might get in the way so you can always might get in the way so you can always resize it or minimize it by clicking resize it or minimize it by clicking resize it or minimize it by clicking this icon here this icon here this icon here so this was our first python program now so this was our first python program now so this was our first python program now if you didn't see the result i showed if you didn't see the result i showed if you didn't see the result i showed you in this video use the comment box you in this video use the comment box you in this video use the comment box below and tell me what error you below and tell me what error you below and tell me what error you encountered i'll do my best to help you encountered i'll do my best to help you encountered i'll do my best to help you move forward in this python tutorial we're going to in this python tutorial we're going to in this python tutorial we're going to take this program to the next level take this program to the next level take this program to the next level we're going to make it more interesting we're going to make it more interesting we're going to make it more interesting so i'm going to show you how to draw a so i'm going to show you how to draw a so i'm going to show you how to draw a dog here dog here dog here as part of this tutorial you will learn as part of this tutorial you will learn as part of this tutorial you will learn how python code gets executed and you how python code gets executed and you how python code gets executed and you will also learn about a few programming will also learn about a few programming will also learn about a few programming terms terms terms so press enter and on line two write so press enter and on line two write so press enter and on line two write another print statement so print open another print statement so print open another print statement so print open and close parenthesis add a quotation and close parenthesis add a quotation and close parenthesis add a quotation now here we want to draw a dog so i now here we want to draw a dog so i now here we want to draw a dog so i don't know that is the head of our dog don't know that is the head of our dog don't know that is the head of our dog followed by four hyphens one two three followed by four hyphens one two three followed by four hyphens one two three four so this is the body all right now four so this is the body all right now four so this is the body all right now one more time one more time one more time another print statement with quotations another print statement with quotations another print statement with quotations now we need to draw the legs so add a now we need to draw the legs so add a now we need to draw the legs so add a space space space followed by four vertical bars so like followed by four vertical bars so like followed by four vertical bars so like this this this so here's a little imaginary dog now so here's a little imaginary dog now so here's a little imaginary dog now let's run this program and see what we let's run this program and see what we let's run this program and see what we get so in the top right corner you get so in the top right corner you get so in the top right corner you should see this play button click that should see this play button click that should see this play button click that there you go so we have our name and there you go so we have our name and there you go so we have our name and right below that we have our imaginary right below that we have our imaginary right below that we have our imaginary dog dog dog now what you need to understand here is now what you need to understand here is now what you need to understand here is that our python code gets executed line that our python code gets executed line that our python code gets executed line by line from the top by line from the top by line from the top so earlier i told you about python so earlier i told you about python so earlier i told you about python interpreter that is the program that interpreter that is the program that interpreter that is the program that knows how to translate or interpret our knows how to translate or interpret our knows how to translate or interpret our python code into instructions that a python code into instructions that a python code into instructions that a computer can understand so when we run computer can understand so when we run computer can understand so when we run this program by clicking this icon here this program by clicking this icon here this program by clicking this icon here python interpreter starts executing or python interpreter starts executing or python interpreter starts executing or running our program line by line from running our program line by line from running our program line by line from the top so first it executes line one the top so first it executes line one the top so first it executes line one then moves on to line two and so on then moves on to line two and so on then moves on to line two and so on so this is how python programs get so this is how python programs get so this is how python programs get executed now let me show you something executed now let me show you something executed now let me show you something cool let's add another print statement cool let's add another print statement cool let's add another print statement with quotations now in between the with quotations now in between the with quotations now in between the quotations add a star or an asterisk quotations add a star or an asterisk quotations add a star or an asterisk like this now after the quotation and like this now after the quotation and like this now after the quotation and before the parenthesis add a space once before the parenthesis add a space once before the parenthesis add a space once again add an asterisk space again add an asterisk space again add an asterisk space 10. 10. 10. what is going on here what is going on here what is going on here well well well anywhere we have quotations like here or anywhere we have quotations like here or anywhere we have quotations like here or here we're defining a string a string is here we're defining a string a string is here we're defining a string a string is a programming term which means a series a programming term which means a series a programming term which means a series of characters so here we have a string of characters so here we have a string of characters so here we have a string we also have a string on line three we also have a string on line three we also have a string on line three as well as line two and line one as well as line two and line one as well as line two and line one now here we are multiplying the string now here we are multiplying the string now here we are multiplying the string by number 10. so this is the by number 10. so this is the by number 10. so this is the multiplication operator just like the multiplication operator just like the multiplication operator just like the multiplication operator we have in math multiplication operator we have in math multiplication operator we have in math so with this piece of code we can draw so with this piece of code we can draw so with this piece of code we can draw 10 asterisks on the terminal let me show 10 asterisks on the terminal let me show 10 asterisks on the terminal let me show you so let's run this program one more you so let's run this program one more you so let's run this program one more time there you go time there you go time there you go so we have 10 asterisks so we have 10 asterisks so we have 10 asterisks now what we have here this piece of code now what we have here this piece of code now what we have here this piece of code here here here is called an expression an expression is is called an expression an expression is is called an expression an expression is a piece of code that produces a value so a piece of code that produces a value so a piece of code that produces a value so when py's interpreter tries to execute when py's interpreter tries to execute when py's interpreter tries to execute line 4 line 4 line 4 first it will evaluate the code that we first it will evaluate the code that we first it will evaluate the code that we put in between parentheses so it will put in between parentheses so it will put in between parentheses so it will evaluate our expression our expression evaluate our expression our expression evaluate our expression our expression will produce 10 asterisks and then those will produce 10 asterisks and then those will produce 10 asterisks and then those asterisks will be printed on the asterisks will be printed on the asterisks will be printed on the terminal terminal terminal now as an exercise you can use this now as an exercise you can use this now as an exercise you can use this print statement to draw another shape print statement to draw another shape print statement to draw another shape you can draw a heart a ball whatever you you can draw a heart a ball whatever you you can draw a heart a ball whatever you like i will see you in the next tutorial like i will see you in the next tutorial like i will see you in the next tutorial one of the questions i get a lot on my one of the questions i get a lot on my one of the questions i get a lot on my channel is how long does it take to channel is how long does it take to channel is how long does it take to learn python and become job ready well learn python and become job ready well learn python and become job ready well there is no single answer it really there is no single answer it really there is no single answer it really depends on you and how much effort and depends on you and how much effort and depends on you and how much effort and commitment you want to put into this but commitment you want to put into this but commitment you want to put into this but i would say if you spend two hours every i would say if you spend two hours every i would say if you spend two hours every day consistently day consistently day consistently after about three months you should be after about three months you should be after about three months you should be able to write basic python programs but able to write basic python programs but able to write basic python programs but quite honestly that doesn't get you a quite honestly that doesn't get you a quite honestly that doesn't get you a job job job in order to get a job you need to in order to get a job you need to in order to get a job you need to specialize in one area what do you want specialize in one area what do you want specialize in one area what do you want to use python for do you want to use it to use python for do you want to use it to use python for do you want to use it to build web applications or desktop to build web applications or desktop to build web applications or desktop applications or do you want to use it in applications or do you want to use it in applications or do you want to use it in machine learning and artificial machine learning and artificial machine learning and artificial intelligence so whatever you want to do intelligence so whatever you want to do intelligence so whatever you want to do you need to take additional courses for you need to take additional courses for you need to take additional courses for example if you want to become a web example if you want to become a web example if you want to become a web developer in addition to learning python developer in addition to learning python developer in addition to learning python you should also learn about html css you should also learn about

specific to programming they're not specific to programming they're not specific to python they exist in pretty much every python they exist in pretty much every python they exist in pretty much every programming language out there programming language out there programming language out there we use variables to temporarily store we use variables to temporarily store we use variables to temporarily store data in a computer's memory here's an data in a computer's memory here's an data in a computer's memory here's an example let's type price equals 10. example let's type price equals 10. example let's type price equals 10. when python interpreter executes this when python interpreter executes this when python interpreter executes this code it will allocate some memory then code it will allocate some memory then code it will allocate some memory then it will store the number 10 in that it will store the number 10 in that it will store the number 10 in that memory and finally it will attach this memory and finally it will attach this memory and finally it will attach this price label to that memory location price label to that memory location price label to that memory location as a metaphor imagine we have a box in as a metaphor imagine we have a box in as a metaphor imagine we have a box in that box we have number 10 and price is that box we have number 10 and price is that box we have number 10 and price is the label that we put on the box the label that we put on the box the label that we put on the box now we can use this label anywhere in now we can use this label anywhere in now we can use this label anywhere in our program to access the value that we our program to access the value that we our program to access the value that we have in that box this is a very have in that box this is a very have in that box this is a very simplified explanation simplified explanation simplified explanation so now let's print price on the terminal so now let's print price on the terminal so now let's print price on the terminal print now this time we're not going to print now this time we're not going to print now this time we're not going to add quotations because if we put add quotations because if we put add quotations because if we put quotations here we will see the text quotations here we will see the text quotations here we will see the text price on the terminal not the value of price on the terminal not the value of price on the terminal not the value of the price variable so delete quotations the price variable so delete quotations the price variable so delete quotations and type price and type price and type price now let's run this program one more time now let's run this program one more time now let's run this program one more time there you go so we see 10 on the there you go so we see 10 on the there you go so we see 10 on the terminal terminal terminal so this is how we define variables we so this is how we define variables we so this is how we define variables we start with an identifier which is the start with an identifier which is the start with an identifier which is the name of our variable then an equal sign name of our variable then an equal sign name of our variable then an equal sign and finally a value now more accurately and finally a value now more accurately and finally a value now more accurately when this number 10 is about to be when this number 10 is about to be when this number 10 is about to be stored in the memory first it will get stored in the memory first it will get stored in the memory first it will get converted to its binary representation converted to its binary representation converted to its binary representation so this number 10 that we have is in the so this number 10 that we have is in the so this number 10 that we have is in the decimal system which has all the digits decimal system which has all the digits decimal system which has all the digits from 0 to 9. computers don't understand from 0 to 9. computers don't understand from 0 to 9. computers don't understand all these digits they only understand all these digits they only understand all these digits they only understand zeros and ones so when we store the zeros and ones so when we store the zeros and ones so when we store the number 10 in the computer's memory first number 10 in the computer's memory first number 10 in the computer's memory first it will get converted to its binary it will get converted to its binary it will get converted to its binary representation which would be a bunch of representation which would be a bunch of representation which would be a bunch of zeros and ones like zero zero one zero zeros and ones like zero zero one zero zeros and ones like zero zero one zero zero one whatever i don't know then it zero one whatever i don't know then it zero one whatever i don't know then it would get stored in the computer's would get stored in the computer's would get stored in the computer's memory so let's take this program to the memory so let's take this program to the memory so let's take this program to the next level next level next level on the second line we can update the on the second line we can update the on the second line we can update the value of this price variable so we can value of this price variable so we can value of this price variable so we can reset it to a new value like 20. now reset it to a new value like 20. now reset it to a new value like 20. now when we run our program we should see 20 when we run our program we should see 20 when we run our program we should see 20 because as i told you before python because as i told you before python because as i told you before python interpreter executes our code line by interpreter executes our code line by interpreter executes our code line by line from the top so first we set price line from the top so first we set price line from the top so first we set price to 10 then we reset it to 20 and finally to 10 then we reset it to 20 and finally to 10 then we reset it to 20 and finally we print it on the terminal let's run we print it on the terminal let's run we print it on the terminal let's run the program the program the program there you go so we see 20 here okay there you go so we see 20 here okay there you go so we see 20 here okay now these numbers that we have here are now these numbers that we have here are now these numbers that we have here are whole numbers without a decimal point in whole numbers without a decimal point in whole numbers without a decimal point in programming we refer to these numbers as programming we refer to these numbers as programming we refer to these numbers as integers so an integer is a number integers so an integer is a number integers so an integer is a number without a decimal point without a decimal point without a decimal point we can also use numbers with a decimal we can also use numbers with a decimal we can also use numbers with a decimal point for example here on line 2 we can point for example here on line 2 we can point for example here on line 2 we can define another variable called rating define another variable called rating define another variable called rating and we set it to 4.9 and we set it to 4.9 and we set it to 4.9 now in programming refer to this kind of now in programming refer to this kind of now in programming refer to this kind of number as a floating point number or number as a floating point number or number as a floating point number or float for short so we have integers and float for short so we have integers and float for short so we have integers and floats floats floats we can also define a variable and set it we can also define a variable and set it we can also define a variable and set it to a string for example to a string for example to a string for example name equals mosh name equals mosh name equals mosh we also have another kind of value which we also have another kind of value which we also have another kind of value which is called boolean which can be true or is called boolean which can be true or is called boolean which can be true or false they are like yes and no in false they are like yes and no in false they are like yes and no in english here's an example i'm going to english here's an example i'm going to english here's an example i'm going to define a variable is underline published define a variable is underline published define a variable is underline published so we use an underscore to separate so we use an underscore to separate so we use an underscore to separate multiple words in our variable's name multiple words in our variable's name multiple words in our variable's name we set this to we set this to we set this to true true true or or or false these are the boolean values false these are the boolean values false these are the boolean values now note that python is a case sensitive now note that python is a case sensitive now note that python is a case sensitive language which means it's sensitive to language which means it's sensitive to language which means it's sensitive to lowercase and uppercase characters so lowercase and uppercase characters so lowercase and uppercase characters so when defining variables we should always when defining variables we should always when defining variables we should always use lowercase letters but here false and use lowercase letters but here false and use lowercase letters but here false and true are special keywords in the true are special keywords in the true are special keywords in the language so if we spell it with a language so if we spell it with a language so if we spell it with a lowercase f python doesn't understand it lowercase f python doesn't understand it lowercase f python doesn't understand it you can see we have a red underline here you can see we have a red underline here you can see we have a red underline here which indicates an error so make sure to which indicates an error so make sure to which indicates an error so make sure to spell this with a capital f or if you spell this with a capital f or if you spell this with a capital f or if you want to set this to true make sure want to set this to true make sure want to set this to true make sure t is capital t is capital t is capital so in this program we are storing simple so in this program we are storing simple so in this program we are storing simple values in our computer's memory simple values in our computer's memory simple values in our computer's memory simple values can be numbers which can be values can be numbers which can be values can be numbers which can be integers or floats or they can be integers or floats or they can be integers or floats or they can be strings or booleans but in python we can strings or booleans but in python we can strings or booleans but in python we can also store complex values like lists and also store complex values like lists and also store complex values like lists and objects and that's what i'm going to objects and that's what i'm going to objects and that's what i'm going to show you in the future show you in the future show you in the future so before going any further i want you so before going any further i want you so before going any further i want you to do a little exercise imagine we're to do a little exercise imagine we're to do a little exercise imagine we're going to write a program for a hospital going to write a program for a hospital going to write a program for a hospital so we're checking a patient named john so we're checking a patient named john so we're checking a patient named john smith he's 20 years old and is a new smith he's 20 years old and is a new smith he's 20 years old and is a new patient i want you to define three patient i want you to define three patient i want you to define three variables here for his name his age and variables here for his name his age and variables here for his name his age and another variable to tell if this is a another variable to tell if this is a another variable to tell if this is a new or an existing patient so pause the new or an existing patient so pause the new or an existing patient so pause the video and spend one minute on this video and spend one minute on this video and spend one minute on this exercise when you're done come back exercise when you're done come back exercise when you're done come back continue see my solution all right so here we need three all right so here we need three all right so here we need three variables the first one is the patient's variables the first one is the patient's variables the first one is the patient's name name name we said that to we said that to we said that to john smith we can also call this full john smith we can also call this full john smith we can also call this full name these are both valid names for our name these are both valid names for our name these are both valid names for our variables variables variables the second variable is for the age of the second variable is for the age of the second variable is for the age of our patient so age is 20 our patient so age is 20 our patient so age is 20 and finally we need a variable to tell and finally we need a variable to tell and finally we need a variable to tell if this is a new or an existing patient if this is a new or an existing patient if this is a new or an existing patient that's where we can use a boolean value that's where we can use a boolean value that's where we can use a boolean value so we define a variable is new and we so we define a variable is new and we so we define a variable is new and we set it to true so you have learned how to print so you have learned how to print so you have learned how to print messages on the terminal window in this messages on the terminal window in this messages on the terminal window in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to tutorial i'm going to show you how to tutorial i'm going to show you how to receive input from the user so we're receive input from the user so we're receive input from the user so we're going to write a small program that asks going to write a small program that asks going to write a small program that asks the user's name and then it will print a the user's name and then it will print a the user's name and then it will print a greeting message customized for that greeting message customized for that greeting message customized for that user user user so instead of prints we're going to use so instead of prints we're going to use so instead of prints we're going to use input input input now both this input and print are now both this input and print are now both this input and print are functions that are built into python as functions that are built into python as functions that are built into python as a metaphor think of the remote control a metaphor think of the remote control a metaphor think of the remote control of your tv on this remote control we of your tv on this remote control we of your tv on this remote control we have a bunch of buttons these are the have a bunch of buttons these are the have a bunch of buttons these are the functions built into your tv you can functions built into your tv you can functions built into your tv you can turn it on turn it off change the volume turn it on turn it off change the volume turn it on turn it off change the volume and so on in python we also have a bunch and so on in python we also have a bunch and so on in python we also have a bunch of functions for common tasks such as of functions for common tasks such as of functions for common tasks such as printing messages receiving input and so printing messages receiving input and so printing messages receiving input and so on so we're going to use the input on so we're going to use the input on so we're going to use the input function function function now whenever we have this parenthesis we now whenever we have this parenthesis we now whenever we have this parenthesis we say we're calling or executing that say we're calling or executing that say we're calling or executing that function it's like pressing a button on function it's like pressing a button on function it's like pressing a button on a remote control so we're going to call a remote control so we're going to call a remote control so we're going to call the input function the input function the input function and in between parentheses we want to and in between parentheses we want to and in between parentheses we want to add a string to print something on the add a string to print something on the add a string to print something on the terminal terminal terminal what is your name what is your name what is your name with a question mark followed by a space with a question mark followed by a space with a question mark followed by a space you will see why in a second you will see why in a second you will see why in a second so this input function will print this so this input function will print this so this input function will print this message on the terminal and then it will message on the terminal and then it will message on the terminal and then it will wait for the user to enter a value wait for the user to enter a value wait for the user to enter a value whatever the user enters this input whatever the user enters this input whatever the user enters this input function will return so now we can get function will return so now we can get function will return so now we can get that value and store it in the memory that value and store it in the memory that value and store it in the memory using a variable so we get the result using a variable so we get the result using a variable so we get the result and put it in a variable called name and put it in a variable called name and put it in a variable called name okay okay okay now on the second line we want to print now on the second line we want to print now on the second line we want to print a message like hi john or hi mosh a message like hi john or hi mosh a message like hi john or hi mosh whatever so print whatever so print whatever so print quotations hi quotations hi quotations hi with a space now after the quotation we with a space now after the quotation we with a space now after the quotation we want to dynamically print want to dynamically print want to dynamically print what we have in the name variable so we what we have in the name variable so we what we have in the name variable so we add add add a plus sign and then name a plus sign and then name a plus sign and then name so here we have hi which is a string so here we have hi which is a string so here we have hi which is a string we're concatenating or combining the we're concatenating or combining the we're concatenating or combining the string with another string that is what string with another string that is what string with another string that is what we have in the name variable we have in the name variable we have in the name variable so here's another example of an so here's another example of an so here's another example of an expression remember what is an expression remember what is an expression remember what is an expression it's a piece of code that expression it's a piece of code that expression it's a piece of code that produces a value so this expression produces a value so this expression produces a value so this expression concatenates or combines two strings concatenates or combines two strings concatenates or combines two strings let's run this program and see what let's run this program and see what let's run this program and see what happens so run happens so run happens so run okay here's the question what is your okay here's the question what is your okay here's the question what is your name name name mosh now note that earlier we added a mosh now note that earlier we added a mosh now note that earlier we added a space after the question mark we did space after the question mark we did space after the question mark we did this so this so this so here in the terminal window the cursor here in the terminal window the cursor here in the terminal window the cursor is separated from the question mark is separated from the question mark is separated from the question mark otherwise it will be so close so let's otherwise it will be so close so let's otherwise it will be so close so let's type whatever here press enter now we type whatever here press enter now we type whatever here press enter now we get this message hi mosh get this message hi mosh get this message hi mosh now here's a little exercise for you i now here's a little exercise for you i now here's a little exercise for you i want you to extend this program and ask want you to extend this program and ask want you to extend this program and ask two questions first ask the person's two questions first ask the person's two questions first ask the person's name and then their favorite color and name and then their favorite color and name and then their favorite color and then print a message like mosh likes then print a message like mosh likes then print a message like mosh likes blue blue blue so pause the video do this exercise and so pause the video do this exercise and so pause the video do this exercise and then come back continue watching all right so here's the first question all right so here's the first question all right so here's the first question right after that we're going to call the right after that we're going to call the right after that we're going to call the input function one more time this time input function one more time this time input function one more time this time we're going to ask a different question we're going to ask a different question we're going to ask a different question what is your favorite what is your favorite what is your favorite color color color now we get the new value and store it in now we get the new value and store it in now we get the new value and store it in a variable called color or we could call a variable called color or we could call a variable called color or we could call it favorite underline color either works it favorite underline color either works it favorite underline color either works and finally we're going to change what and finally we're going to change what and finally we're going to change what we pass to the print function we pass to the print function we pass to the print function so first we print the name so first we print the name so first we print the name then we concatenate this with a string then we concatenate this with a string then we concatenate this with a string here we're going to type likes here we're going to type likes here we're going to type likes we also put one space before and after we also put one space before and after we also put one space before and after likes and once again we concatenate this likes and once again we concatenate this likes and once again we concatenate this with the favorite color so with the favorite color so with the favorite color so favorite color favorite color favorite color now let's run this program now let's run this program now let's run this program so what is your name so what is your name so what is your name mosh enter favorite color blue enter mosh enter favorite color blue enter mosh enter favorite color blue enter we get this message mosh likes blue hey guys marsh here i just wanted to let hey guys marsh here i just wanted to let hey guys marsh here i just wanted to let you know that you really don't have to you know that you really don't have to you know that you really don't have to memorize anything in this course because memorize anything in this course

liking this support my hard work by liking this support my hard work by liking this video and sharing it with others so they video and sharing it with others so they video and sharing it with others so they can learn as well and be sure to can learn as well and be sure to can learn as well and be sure to subscribe to my channel for more subscribe to my channel for more subscribe to my channel for more tutorials like this alright now let's tutorials like this alright now let's tutorials like this alright now let's move on to the next tutorial in this python tutorial we're going to in this python tutorial we're going to in this python tutorial we're going to write a program that will ask the year write a program that will ask the year write a program that will ask the year we were born in and then it will we were born in and then it will we were born in and then it will calculate our age and print it on the calculate our age and print it on the calculate our age and print it on the terminal so let's start with our input terminal so let's start with our input terminal so let's start with our input function input function input function input let's print birth year followed by a let's print birth year followed by a let's print birth year followed by a colon and a space colon and a space colon and a space now let's get the return value and store now let's get the return value and store now let's get the return value and store it in a variable called birth underline it in a variable called birth underline it in a variable called birth underline year year year so as i told you before we use an so as i told you before we use an so as i told you before we use an underscore to separate multiple words underscore to separate multiple words underscore to separate multiple words next we need to calculate the age so we next we need to calculate the age so we next we need to calculate the age so we define another variable called age define another variable called age define another variable called age and here we do some basic math currently and here we do some basic math currently and here we do some basic math currently we are in 2019. so let's write an we are in 2019. so let's write an we are in 2019. so let's write an expression like this 2019 minus birth expression like this 2019 minus birth expression like this 2019 minus birth year year year now finally let's print now finally let's print now finally let's print age on the terminal let's run our age on the terminal let's run our age on the terminal let's run our program and see what happens so program and see what happens so program and see what happens so my birth year is 1982. my birth year is 1982. my birth year is 1982. enter oops we got an error what is going enter oops we got an error what is going enter oops we got an error what is going on here on here on here so whenever you say this red message so whenever you say this red message so whenever you say this red message that means there is something wrong in that means there is something wrong in that means there is something wrong in your program with the information here your program with the information here your program with the information here we can find exactly where the error we can find exactly where the error we can find exactly where the error occurred so occurred so occurred so next to the file you can see the file next to the file you can see the file next to the file you can see the file that generated this error in this case that generated this error in this case that generated this error in this case that is that is that is app.pi so currently our program has only app.pi so currently our program has only app.pi so currently our program has only a single file but real complex programs a single file but real complex programs a single file but real complex programs often have hundreds or even thousands of often have hundreds or even thousands of often have hundreds or even thousands of files so in this file on line two this files so in this file on line two this files so in this file on line two this is where we got this error and right is where we got this error and right is where we got this error and right below that you can see below that you can see below that you can see the piece of code that generated this the piece of code that generated this the piece of code that generated this error so that is where we're calculating error so that is where we're calculating error so that is where we're calculating the h and right below that you can see the h and right below that you can see the h and right below that you can see the type of the error in this case we the type of the error in this case we the type of the error in this case we have a type error and here's the message have a type error and here's the message have a type error and here's the message unsupported operand types for unsupported operand types for unsupported operand types for subtraction subtraction subtraction and and and and and and stir stir stir so int is short for integer and that so int is short for integer and that so int is short for integer and that represents a whole number represents a whole number represents a whole number and stir is short for string so here and stir is short for string so here and stir is short for string so here we're subtracting a string from an we're subtracting a string from an we're subtracting a string from an integer and python doesn't know what to integer and python doesn't know what to integer and python doesn't know what to do with it let me explain so i'm going do with it let me explain so i'm going do with it let me explain so i'm going to close the terminal window to close the terminal window to close the terminal window so after the first line is executed we so after the first line is executed we so after the first line is executed we have this birth year variable set to a have this birth year variable set to a have this birth year variable set to a string so whatever we type in the string so whatever we type in the string so whatever we type in the terminal is always treated as a string terminal is always treated as a string terminal is always treated as a string even if we type a number in other words even if we type a number in other words even if we type a number in other words when we run this program this burst year when we run this program this burst year when we run this program this burst year variable will be set variable will be set variable will be set to a string to a string to a string with four characters one nine eight two with four characters one nine eight two with four characters one nine eight two this string is different from the actual this string is different from the actual this string is different from the actual number 1982 one is an integer the other number 1982 one is an integer the other number 1982 one is an integer the other is a string is a string is a string right so right so right so back to line two back to line two back to line two where this error occurred where this error occurred where this error occurred at runtime which means when we run our at runtime which means when we run our at runtime which means when we run our program this expression on the right program this expression on the right program this expression on the right side of the assignment operator is going side of the assignment operator is going side of the assignment operator is going to look like this to look like this to look like this minus minus minus string 1982. string 1982. string 1982. python doesn't know how to interpret or python doesn't know how to interpret or python doesn't know how to interpret or how to evaluate this expression how to evaluate this expression how to evaluate this expression to fix this problem we need to convert to fix this problem we need to convert to fix this problem we need to convert this 1982 into an integer and then we'll this 1982 into an integer and then we'll this 1982 into an integer and then we'll be able to subtract it from 2019 and be able to subtract it from 2019 and be able to subtract it from 2019 and that is very easy so far you have that is very easy so far you have that is very easy so far you have learned about two built-in functions one learned about two built-in functions one learned about two built-in functions one is print the other is input we have a is print the other is input we have a is print the other is input we have a few more functions for converting values few more functions for converting values few more functions for converting values into different types so we have int for into different types so we have int for into different types so we have int for converting a string into an integer we converting a string into an integer we converting a string into an integer we also have float for converting a string also have float for converting a string also have float for converting a string into a float or a number with a decimal into a float or a number with a decimal into a float or a number with a decimal point and we also have bool for point and we also have bool for point and we also have bool for converting a string into a boolean value converting a string into a boolean value converting a string into a boolean value so so so to fix this problem to fix this problem to fix this problem we need to go back on line two we need to go back on line two we need to go back on line two and and and pass this birth year variable to the int pass this birth year variable to the int pass this birth year variable to the int function like this function like this function like this int parenthesis like this int parenthesis like this int parenthesis like this so we pass this string to the in so we pass this string to the in so we pass this string to the in function int will convert it to an function int will convert it to an function int will convert it to an integer and then integer and then integer and then python interpreter will be able to python interpreter will be able to python interpreter will be able to evaluate this expression now let's run evaluate this expression now let's run evaluate this expression now let's run this program one more time this program one more time this program one more time so birth here is 1982 enter so i am 37 so birth here is 1982 enter so i am 37 so birth here is 1982 enter so i am 37 years old years old years old in python we have a useful function for in python we have a useful function for in python we have a useful function for getting the type of variables for getting the type of variables for getting the type of variables for example let's print the type of birth example let's print the type of birth example let's print the type of birth year so right after line one let's print year so right after line one let's print year so right after line one let's print now here we're going to call another now here we're going to call another now here we're going to call another built-in function called type built-in function called type built-in function called type and now let's pass and now let's pass and now let's pass birth year birth year birth year okay now similarly after line three okay now similarly after line three okay now similarly after line three let's also print the type of h so print let's also print the type of h so print let's also print the type of h so print type of age type of age type of age okay let's run our program okay let's run our program okay let's run our program so birth here one more time 1982 so birth here one more time 1982 so birth here one more time 1982 okay here's the result so the type of okay here's the result so the type of okay here's the result so the type of burst year as you can see burst year as you can see burst year as you can see is a class of stir or string is a class of stir or string is a class of stir or string we'll look at classes in the future so we'll look at classes in the future so we'll look at classes in the future so for now don't worry about them and also for now don't worry about them and also for now don't worry about them and also below that you can see that the type of below that you can see that the type of below that you can see that the type of the age variable is int or integer the age variable is int or integer the age variable is int or integer so here's what you need to take away so here's what you need to take away so here's what you need to take away whenever you use the input function you whenever you use the input function you whenever you use the input function you always get a string so if you're always get a string so if you're always get a string so if you're expecting a numerical value you should expecting a numerical value you should expecting a numerical value you should always convert that string into either always convert that string into either always convert that string into either an integer or a float an integer or a float an integer or a float but here's a little exercise for you i but here's a little exercise for you i but here's a little exercise for you i want you to write a program ask the user want you to write a program ask the user want you to write a program ask the user their weight and then convert it to their weight and then convert it to their weight and then convert it to kilograms and print it on the terminal kilograms and print it on the terminal kilograms and print it on the terminal so pause the video do the exercise and so pause the video do the exercise and so pause the video do the exercise and when you're ready come back continue when you're ready come back continue when you're ready come back continue watching all right so let's use our input all right so let's use our input all right so let's use our input function function function and ask for the weight and ask for the weight and ask for the weight in pounds in pounds in pounds here we get the weight here we get the weight here we get the weight in lbs or pounds in lbs or pounds in lbs or pounds now we need to convert this into now we need to convert this into now we need to convert this into kilogram that is very easy so we define kilogram that is very easy so we define kilogram that is very easy so we define another variable weight underline another variable weight underline another variable weight underline kilogram or kg we set this to kilogram or kg we set this to kilogram or kg we set this to weight underline lbs weight underline lbs weight underline lbs times times times 0.45 0.45 0.45 and finally let's print weight and finally let's print weight and finally let's print weight on the line kilogram let's run this on the line kilogram let's run this on the line kilogram let's run this python program and see what happens python program and see what happens python program and see what happens so my weight is 160. so my weight is 160. so my weight is 160. all right once again we got an error all right once again we got an error all right once again we got an error can't multiply sequence by non-end of can't multiply sequence by non-end of can't multiply sequence by non-end of type float so as i told you before this type float so as i told you before this type float so as i told you before this input function returns a string so we input function returns a string so we input function returns a string so we cannot multiply a string by a float cannot multiply a string by a float cannot multiply a string by a float python doesn't know what to do with it python doesn't know what to do with it python doesn't know what to do with it so in this case we should convert this so in this case we should convert this so in this case we should convert this number to an integer or a float and then number to an integer or a float and then number to an integer or a float and then multiply it by 0.45 multiply it by 0.45 multiply it by 0.45 so let's call the int function and pass weight underline lbs and run and pass weight underline lbs and run and pass weight underline lbs and run our program one more time our program one more time our program one more time okay so i am 72 kilograms in this tutorial you're going to learn in this tutorial you're going to learn in this tutorial you're going to learn more about python strings so i've more about python strings so i've more about python strings so i've defined this course variable and set it defined this course variable and set it defined this course variable and set it to python for beginners now earlier i to python for beginners now earlier i to python for beginners now earlier i told you that you can use both single told you that you can use both single told you that you can use both single and double quotes to define a string but and double quotes to define a string but and double quotes to define a string but there are times that you have to use a there are times that you have to use a there are times that you have to use a specific form otherwise you're going to specific form otherwise you're going to specific form otherwise you're going to run into issues here's an example run into issues here's an example run into issues here's an example imagine we want to change this string imagine we want to change this string imagine we want to change this string into python's course for beginners so we into python's course for beginners so we into python's course for beginners so we want to add an apostrophe like this want to add an apostrophe like this want to add an apostrophe like this pythons pythons pythons course course course for beginners you can immediately see for beginners you can immediately see for beginners you can immediately see this is going crazy this is going crazy this is going crazy because our string starts here and then because our string starts here and then because our string starts here and then terminates here all these characters terminates here all these characters terminates here all these characters that we have after the second apostrophe that we have after the second apostrophe that we have after the second apostrophe python interpreter doesn't know what python interpreter doesn't know what python interpreter doesn't know what they are so to solve this problem we they are so to solve this problem we they are so to solve this problem we need to use double quotes to define our need to use double quotes to define our need to use double quotes to define our string so we can have a single quote in string so we can have a single quote in string so we can have a single quote in the middle of the string so let's change the middle of the string so let's change the middle of the string so let's change this to double quotes now you can see it this to double quotes now you can see it this to double quotes now you can see it adds another double quote to close it we adds another double quote to close it we adds another double quote to close it we have to manually remove this have to manually remove this have to manually remove this and also one more time at the beginning and also one more time at the beginning and also one more time at the beginning of the string of the string of the string we need to add another double quote now we need to add another double quote now we need to add another double quote now you can see the error is gone so if we you can see the error is gone so if we you can see the error is gone so if we print print print course course course we see we see we see python scores for beginners python scores for beginners python scores for beginners beautiful now let's say we don't want beautiful now let's say we don't want beautiful now let's say we don't want this apostrophe here so we have python this apostrophe here so we have python this apostrophe here so we have python for beginners but we want to put for beginners but we want to put for beginners but we want to put beginners in double quotes beginners in double quotes beginners in double quotes once again if you add a double quote once again if you add a double quote once again if you add a double quote here python interpreter gets confused here python interpreter gets confused here python interpreter gets confused because it assumes the second double because it assumes the second double because it assumes the second double code indicates the end of our string so code indicates the end of our string so code indicates the end of our string so it doesn't know what these characters it doesn't know what these characters it doesn't know what these characters are are are so to solve this so to solve this so to solve this we need to change our double quotes to we need to change our double quotes to we need to change our double quotes to single quotes like this and then we can single quotes like this and then we can single quotes like this and then we can add double quotes in the middle of the add double quotes in the middle of the add double quotes in the middle of the string string string now let's run this program now let's run this program now let's run this program there you go so we get python for there you go so we get python for there you go so we get python for beginners beginners beginners so these are the cases for using single so these are the cases for using single so these are the cases for using single or double quotes now in all the examples or double quotes now in all the examples or double quotes now in all the examples i've shown you so far we only deal with i've shown you so far we only deal with i've shown you so far we only deal with short strings but what if you want to short strings but what if you want to short strings but what if you want to define a string that is multiple lines define a string that is multiple lines define a string that is multiple lines for example what if you want to define a for example what if you want to define a for example what if you want to define a string for the message that we send in string for the message that we send in string for the message that we send in an email in that case we need to use an email in that case we need to use an email in that case we need to use triple quotes so let me delete this triple quotes so let me delete this triple quotes so let me delete this now we add three quotes so one two three now we add three quotes so one two three now we add three quotes so one two three there you go there you go there you go so we have three quotes to start our so we have three quotes to start our so we have three quotes to start our string and three to terminate it again string and three to terminate it again string and three to terminate it again these codes can be single or double these codes can be single or double these codes can be single or double quotes okay quotes okay quotes okay now with this we can define a string now with this we can define a string now with this we can define a string that spans multiple lines for example we that spans multiple lines for example we that spans multiple lines for example we can say hi john can say hi john can say hi john here is our first email to you here is our first email to you here is our first email to you thank you thank you thank you the support team the support team the support team like that like that like that now now now let's run this program and let's run this program and let's run this program and here's the result so here's the result so here's the result so we get this beautiful multi-line string we get this beautiful multi-line string we get this beautiful multi-line string now let's change this back to something now let's change this back to something now let's change this back to something simple simple simple so we can look at other characteristics so we can look at other characteristics so we can look at other characteristics of strings in python so i'm going to use of strings in python so i'm going to use of strings in python so i'm going to use single quotes and set the course name to single quotes and set the course name to single quotes and set the course name to python for beginners python for beginners python for beginners here we can use square brackets to get a here we can use square brackets to get a here we can use square brackets to get a character at a given index in this character at a given index in this character at a given index in this string let me show you so to get the string let me show you so to get the string let me show you so to get the first character we use square brackets first character we use square brackets first character we use square brackets and type zero so the index of the first and type zero so the index of the first and type zero so the index of the first character in this string is zero in character in this string is zero in character in this string is zero in other words this is how other words this is how other words this is how python strings are indexed zero one two python strings are indexed zero one two python strings are indexed zero one two three 4 and so on so the index of the three 4 and so on so the index of the three 4 and so on so the index of the first character is 0 the second first character is 0 the second first character is 0 the second character is 1 and so on so let me character is 1 and so on so let me character is 1 and so on so let me delete this and run this program delete this and run this program delete this and run this program we get p we get p we get p we can also use a negative index here we can also use a negative index here we can also use a negative index here and this is one of the features that we and this is one of the features that we and this is one of the features that we don't have in other programming don't have in other programming don't have in other programming languages as far as i know so with the languages as far as i know so with the languages as far as i know so with the negative index we can get the characters negative index we can get the characters negative index we can get the characters starting from the end so if i pass starting from the end so if i pass starting from the end so if i pass negative 1 here assuming that 0 is the negative 1 here assuming that 0 is the negative 1 here assuming that 0 is the index of the first character negative index of the first character negative index of the first character negative one is the index of the last character one is the index of the last character one is the index of the last character so when we run this program we should so when we run this program we should so when we run this program we should see s let's run it see s let's run it see s let's run it there you go we get s if we pass there you go we get s if we pass there you go we get s if we pass negative two this will return the second negative two this will return the second negative two this will return the second character from the end let's run it one character from the end let's run it one character from the end let's run it one more time more time more time now we get r because that is the second now we get r because that is the second now we get r because that is the second character from the end okay character from the end okay character from the end okay so pay close attention to this square so pay close attention to this square so pay close attention to this square bracket syntax because quite often it's bracket syntax because quite often it's bracket syntax because quite often it's the topic for online python tests or the topic for online python tests or the topic for online python tests or university exams so if you're preparing university exams so if you're preparing university exams so if you're preparing for a python test make sure to watch for a python test make sure to watch for a python test make sure to watch this tutorial one more time and this tutorial one more time and this tutorial one more time and understand exactly how this square understand exactly how this square understand exactly how this square bracket syntax works bracket syntax works bracket syntax works you can also use a similar syntax to you can also use a similar syntax to you can also use a similar syntax to extract a few characters instead of just extract a few characters instead of just extract a few characters instead of just one character for example one character for example one character for example if we type if we type if we type 0 colon 3 python interpreter will return 0 colon 3 python interpreter will return 0 colon 3 python interpreter will return all the characters starting from this all the characters starting from this all the characters starting from this index all the way to the second index index all the way to the second index index all the way to the second index but it does not return the character at but it does not return the character at but it does not return the character at this index in other words this index in other words this index in other words back to these indexes back to these indexes back to these indexes so we have 0 1 2 3 and so on so we have 0 1 2 3 and so on so we have 0 1 2 3 and so on when we run this program python when we run this program python when we run this program python interpreter will return the characters interpreter will return the characters interpreter will return the characters starting from index 0 starting from index 0 starting from index 0 all the way to index 3 but excludes the all the way to index 3 but excludes the all the way to index 3 but excludes the character and index 3. so when we run character and index 3. so when we run character and index 3. so when we run this python program we're going to see this python program we're going to see this python program we're going to see pipe let me show you so i'm going to pipe let me show you so i'm going to pipe let me show you so i'm going to delete this line delete this line delete this line run this program there you go we get run this program there you go we get run this program there you go we get pipe pipe pipe now here we also have default values for now here we also have default values for now here we also have default values for the start and end index so if we don't the start and end index so if we don't the start and end index so if we don't supply supply supply the end index python will return all the the end index python will return all the the end index python will return all the characters to the end of the string characters to the end of the string characters to the end of the string let's take a look so run this program let's take a look so run this program let's take a look so run this program there you go we get python for beginners there you go we get python for beginners there you go we get python for beginners but if we change the start index to but if we change the start index to but if we change the start index to this will exclude the first character so this will exclude the first character so this will exclude the first character so when we run this program we see when we run this program we see when we run this program we see y-t-h-o-n so p is removed okay y-t-h-o-n so p is removed okay y-t-h-o-n so p is removed okay now similarly we have a default value now similarly we have a default value now similarly we have a default value for the start index so if we don't for the start index so if we don't for the start index so if we don't supply the starting index supply the starting index supply the starting index but add an end index like 5 python but add an end index like 5 python but add an end index like 5 python interpreter will assume 0 as the interpreter will assume 0 as the interpreter will assume 0 as the starting index so let's run this program starting index so let's run this program starting index so let's run this program there you go we get python there you go we get python there you go we get python now what if we leave now what if we leave now what if we leave both the start and end index well i told both the start and end index well i told both the start and end index well i told you that in this case 0 will be assumed you that in this case 0 will be assumed you that in this case 0 will be assumed as the start index and the length of the as the start index and the length of the as the start index and the length of the string will be assumed as the end index string will be assumed as the end index string will be assumed as the end index so with this syntax we can basically so with this syntax we can basically so with this syntax we can basically copy or clone a string in other words if copy or clone a string in other words if copy or clone a string in other words if i define i define i define another variable here let's call it another variable here let's call it another variable here let's call it another and set it to course square another and set it to course square another and set it to course square brackets with just a colon now this brackets with just a colon now this brackets with just a colon now this expression will return all the expression will return all the expression will return all the characters in the course variable so characters in the course variable so characters in the course variable so this second variable will be a copy of this second variable will be a copy of this second variable will be a copy of our first variable let's take a look so our first variable let's take a look so our first variable let's take a look so let's print another let's print another let's print another and run our program there you go we get and run our program there you go we get and run our program there you go we get python for beginners python for beginners python for beginners so once again this square bracket syntax so once again this square bracket syntax so once again this square bracket syntax is pretty important is pretty important is pretty important if you're preparing for online python if you're preparing for online python if you're preparing for online python tests or college exams make sure to tests or college exams make sure to tests or college exams make sure to watch this tutorial again watch this tutorial again watch this tutorial again now here's a little exercise for you i'm now here's a little exercise for you i'm now here's a little exercise for you i'm going to delete all this code going to delete all this code going to delete all this code define a variable called name and set it define a variable called name and set it define a variable called name and set it to jennifer to jennifer to jennifer now when we print now when we print now when we print name name name of of of one one one colon negative one what do you think colon negative one what do you think colon negative one what do you think we're going to see on the terminal i we're going to see on the terminal i we're going to see on the terminal i want you to use your knowledge to tell want you to use your knowledge to tell want you to use your knowledge to tell what we're going to see on the terminal what we're going to see on the terminal what we're going to see on the terminal without running this program so pause without running this program so pause without running this program so pause the video think about it for a few the video think about it for a few the video think about it for a few seconds and then come back continue seconds and then come back continue seconds and then come back continue watching so this expression will return the so this expression will return the so this expression will return the characters starting from index 1 which characters starting from index 1 which characters starting from index 1 which is the second character is the second character is the second character all the way to the first character from all the way to the first character from all the way to the first character from the end but excluding the character at the end but excluding the character at the end but excluding the character at this index in this case the first this index in this case the first this index in this case the first character from the end is r so r will be character from the end is r so r will be character from the end is r so r will be excluded in other words we're gonna see excluded in other words we're gonna see excluded in other words we're gonna see all the characters starting from e all all the characters starting from e all all the characters starting from e all the way the way the way to the second e to the second e to the second e let's take a look so i'm gonna run this let's take a look so i'm gonna run this let's take a look so i'm gonna run this program program program there you go this is what we get and i there you go this is what we get and i there you go this is what we get and i hope you guessed you're great in this tutorial we're going to look at in this tutorial we're going to look at in this tutorial we're going to look at formatted strings in python programming formatted strings in python programming formatted strings in python programming language formatted strings are language formatted strings are language formatted strings are particularly useful in situations where particularly useful in situations where particularly useful in situations where you want to dynamically generate some you want to dynamically generate some you want to dynamically generate some text with your variables let me show you text with your variables let me show you text with your variables let me show you let's say we have two variables first let's say we have two variables first let's say we have two variables first name and last name so first we set this name and last name so first we set this name and last name so first we set this to john to john to john and last we send this to smith now it's and last we send this to smith now it's and last we send this to smith now it's better to call these variables first better to call these variables first better to call these variables first name and last name because they're more name and last name because they're more name and last name because they're more descriptive but here i'm using shorter descriptive but here i'm using shorter descriptive but here i'm using shorter names because i want you to see the names because i want you to see the names because i want you to see the entire code on the screen entire code on the screen entire code on the screen so let's say with these two variables we so let's say with these two variables we so let's say with these two variables we want to generate some text like this want to generate some text like this want to generate some text like this john john john in square brackets smith in square brackets smith in square brackets smith is a coder let's say we want to print is a coder let's say we want to print is a coder let's say we want to print this on a terminal how do we do this this on a terminal how do we do this this on a terminal how do we do this well we define another variable like well we define another variable like well we define another variable like message message message now here we add the first name now we now here we add the first name now we now here we add the first name now we need to concatenate this with a string need to concatenate this with a string need to concatenate this with a string that contains a space and a square that contains a space and a square that contains a space and a square bracket bracket bracket next we need to add the last name next we need to add the last name next we need to add the last name then we need to add a string that then we need to add a string that then we need to add a string that contains the closing square bracket contains the closing square bracket contains the closing square bracket followed by is a coder followed by is a coder followed by is a coder okay so then okay so then okay so then if we print message if we print message if we print message and run this program and run this program and run this program we see john smith is a coder right we see john smith is a coder right we see john smith is a coder right now now now while this approach perfectly works it's while this approach perfectly works it's while this approach perfectly works it's not ideal because as our text gets more not ideal because as our text gets more not ideal because as our text gets more complicated it becomes harder to complicated it becomes harder to complicated it becomes harder to visualize the output visualize the output visualize the output so someone else reading this code they so someone else reading this code they so someone else reading this code they have to visualize all these string have to visualize all these string have to visualize all these string concatenations in their head this is concatenations in their head this is concatenations in their head this is where we use formatted strings they make where we use formatted strings they make where we use formatted strings they make it easier for us to visualize the output it easier for us to visualize the output it easier for us to visualize the output so so so i'm going to define another variable i'm going to define another variable i'm going to define another variable let's say msg short for message and set let's say msg short for message and set let's say msg short for message and set this to a formatted string a formatted this to a formatted string a formatted this to a formatted string a formatted string is one that is prefixed with an f string is one that is prefixed with an f string is one that is prefixed with an f so f so f so f quotes quotes quotes now in between the quotes first we want now in between the quotes first we want now in between the quotes first we want to add the value of the first name to add the value of the first name to add the value of the first name variable so variable so variable so we add curly braces and here we type we add curly braces and here we type we add curly braces and here we type first first first next we add a space we add our square next we add a space we add our square next we add a space we add our square brackets in between the square brackets brackets in between the square brackets brackets in between the square brackets we want to display the last name so once we want to display the last name so once we want to display the last name so once again we add curly braces again we add curly braces again we add curly braces and type last and finally here we type and type last and finally here we type and type last and finally here we type is a coder so this is what we call a is a coder so this is what we call a is a coder so this is what we call a formatted string formatted string formatted string with these curly braces we're defining with these curly braces we're defining with these curly braces we're defining placeholders or holes in our string and placeholders or holes in our string and placeholders or holes in our string and when we run our program these holes will when we run our program these holes will when we run our program these holes will be filled with the value of our be filled with the value of our be filled with the value of our variables so here we have two variables so here we have two variables so here we have two placeholders or two holes in our string placeholders or two holes in our string placeholders or two holes in our string one is for the value of our first name one is for the value of our first name one is for the value of our first name variable and the other is for the value variable and the other is for the value variable and the other is for the value of the last name variable of the last name variable of the last name variable now compare this format a string with now compare this format a string with now compare this format a string with string concatenation with this formatted string concatenation with this formatted string concatenation with this formatted string we can easily visualize what the string we can easily visualize what the string we can easily visualize what the output looks like right now let's print output looks like right now let's print output looks like right now let's print this on the terminal to make sure we get this on the terminal to make sure we get this on the terminal to make sure we get the exact same output so let's print the exact same output so let's print the exact same output so let's print message there you go so john smith is a message there you go so john smith is a message there you go so john smith is a coder coder coder so to define formatted strings prefix so to define formatted strings prefix so to define formatted strings prefix your strings with an f and use curly your strings with an f and use curly your strings with an f and use curly braces to dynamically insert values into braces to dynamically insert values into braces to dynamically insert values into your strings in this python tutorial i'm going to in this python tutorial i'm going to in this python tutorial i'm going to show you some really cool things you can show you some really cool things you can show you some really cool things you can do with python strings do with python strings do with python strings so let's start by defining a variable so let's start by defining a variable so let's start by defining a variable course course course and we set that to python and we set that to python and we set that to python for beginners now to calculate the number of now to calculate the number of now to calculate the number of characters in this string we can use a characters in this string we can use a characters in this string we can use a built-in function called len so len built-in function called len so len built-in function called len so len we give it this course variable and then we give it this course variable and then we give it this course variable and then we can print the result let's run this we can print the result let's run this we can print the result let's run this program program program so as you can see we have 20 characters so as you can see we have 20 characters so as you can see we have 20 characters in this string this is particularly in this string this is particularly in this string this is particularly useful when we receive input from the useful when we receive input from the useful when we receive input from the user for example you have noticed that user for example you have noticed that user for example you have noticed that when you fill out a form online when you fill out a form online when you fill out a form online each input field quit often has a limit each input field quit often has a limit each input field quit often has a limit for example you might have 50 characters for example you might have 50 characters for example you might have 50 characters for your name so using this len function for your name so using this len function for your name so using this len function we can enforce a limit on the number of we can enforce a limit on the number of we can enforce a limit on the number of characters in an input field if the user characters in an input field if the user characters in an input field if the user types in more characters than we allow types in more characters than we allow types in more characters than we allow them we can display an error okay them we can display an error okay them we can display an error okay now now now this len function this len function this len function is another function built into python is another function built into python is another function built into python it's a general purpose function so it's it's a general purpose function so it's it's a general purpose function so it's not limited to counting the number of not limited to counting the number of not limited to counting the number of characters in a string in the future characters in a string in the future characters in a string in the future when we look at lists i'm going to show when we look at lists i'm going to show when we look at lists i'm going to show you that we can use this function to you that we can use this function to you that we can use this function to count the number of items in a list so count the number of items in a list so count the number of items in a list so it's a general purpose function it's a general purpose function it's a general purpose function now we also have functions specific to now we also have functions specific to now we also have functions specific to strings for example we have functions strings for example we have functions strings for example we have functions for converting all these characters to for converting all these characters to for converting all these characters to uppercase or lowercase to access these uppercase or lowercase to access these uppercase or lowercase to access these functions we use the dot operator let me functions we use the dot operator let me functions we use the dot operator let me show you so show you so show you so first we type course then dot first we type course then dot first we type course then dot look these are all the functions that look these are all the functions that look these are all the functions that are specific to strings are specific to strings are specific to strings now in more accurate terms we refer to now in more accurate terms we refer to now in more accurate terms we refer to these functions as methods this is a these functions as methods this is a these functions as methods this is a term in object-oriented programming that term in object-oriented programming that term in object-oriented programming that we'll look at in the future but for now we'll look at in the future but for now we'll look at in the future but for now what i want you to take away is that what i want you to take away is that what i want you to take away is that when a function belongs to something when a function belongs to something when a function belongs to something else or is specific to some kind of else or is specific to some kind of else or is specific to some kind of object we refer to that function as a object we refer to that function as a object we refer to that function as a method for example here we have this method for example here we have this method for example here we have this function function function upper for converting the string into upper for converting the string into upper for converting the string into upper case now more accurately because upper case now more accurately because upper case now more accurately because this function is specific to strings we this function is specific to strings we this function is specific to strings we refer to this as a method in contrast refer to this as a method in contrast refer to this as a method in contrast len and print are general purpose len and print are general purpose len and print are general purpose functions they don't belong to strings functions they don't belong to strings functions they don't belong to strings or numbers or other kinds of objects or numbers or other kinds of objects or numbers or other kinds of objects okay okay okay so this is the difference between so this is the difference between so this is the difference between functions and methods functions and methods functions and methods now let's look at this upper method so now let's look at this upper method so now let's look at this upper method so let's print the result let's print the result let's print the result and run our program there you go we get and run our program there you go we get and run our program there you go we get all these characters displayed in all these characters displayed in all these characters displayed in uppercase now note that this method does uppercase now note that this method does uppercase now note that this method does not change or modify our original string not change or modify our original string not change or modify our original string in fact it creates a new string and in fact it creates a new string and in fact it creates a new string and returns it so returns it so returns it so if we print if we print if we print our course variable right after we call our course variable right after we call our course variable right after we call the upper method you can see that our the upper method you can see that our the upper method you can see that our course variable still has its original course variable still has its original course variable still has its original form so let's run this program one more form so let's run this program one more form so let's run this program one more time there you go look this is our time there you go look this is our time there you go look this is our original course variable it's not original course variable it's not original course variable it's not modified modified modified now similar to the upper method we have now similar to the upper method we have now similar to the upper method we have another method for converting a string another method for converting a string another method for converting a string into lowercase so let me show you print into lowercase so let me show you print into lowercase so let me show you print course dot lower course dot lower course dot lower now let's run the program now let's run the program now let's run the program so on the second line you can see all so on the second line you can see all so on the second line you can see all characters are in lower case characters are in lower case characters are in lower case now there are times that you want to now there are times that you want to now there are times that you want to find a character or a sequence of find a character or a sequence of find a character or a sequence of character in a string in those character in a string in those character in a string in those situations you can use the find method situations you can use the find method situations you can use the find method so let me delete this reliance so let me delete this reliance so let me delete this reliance we call course dot find we call course dot find we call course dot find here we pass a character let's say p here we pass a character let's say p here we pass a character let's say p and this will return the index of the and this will return the index of the and this will return the index of the first occurrence of that character let first occurrence of that character let first occurrence of that character let me show you so let's print the result me show you so let's print the result me show you so let's print the result we get zero we get zero we get zero because the index of the first capital p because the index of the first capital p because the index of the first capital p in our string is zero in our string is zero in our string is zero as another example if we pass a as another example if we pass a as another example if we pass a lowercase o here lowercase o here lowercase o here let's see what we get let's see what we get let's see what we get we get four we get four we get four because the index of this o here is 4. because the index of this o here is 4. because the index of this o here is 4. now note that the find method is case now note that the find method is case now note that the find method is case sensitive so it's sensitive to lowercase sensitive so it's sensitive to lowercase sensitive so it's sensitive to lowercase and uppercase characters as an example and uppercase characters as an example and uppercase characters as an example if we pass an uppercase o here and run if we pass an uppercase o here and run if we pass an uppercase o here and run this program we get negative 1 because this program we get negative 1 because this program we get negative 1 because we don't have an uppercase o anywhere in we don't have an uppercase o anywhere in we don't have an uppercase o anywhere in the string the string the string okay we can also pass a sequence of okay we can also pass a sequence of okay we can also pass a sequence of characters for example we can pass characters for example we can pass characters for example we can pass beginners beginners beginners with a capital b with a capital b with a capital b let's run this program let's run this program let's run this program we get 11 because the word beginners we get 11 because the word beginners we get 11 because the word beginners starts at index 11. starts at index 11. starts at index 11. now we also have a method for replacing now we also have a method for replacing now we also have a method for replacing a character or a sequence of characters a character or a sequence of characters a character or a sequence of characters and that is called replace so let's and that is called replace so let's and that is called replace so let's change find to replace let's say we want change find to replace let's say we want change find to replace let's say we want to replace beginners with absolute to replace beginners with absolute to replace beginners with absolute beginners so we add a comma to pass a beginners so we add a comma to pass a beginners so we add a comma to pass a second value to this function or more second value to this function or more second value to this function or more accurately this method we add a string accurately this method we add a string accurately this method we add a string here i'm going to pass absolute here i'm going to pass absolute here i'm going to pass absolute beginners beginners beginners okay okay okay now let's run this program now let's run this program now let's run this program so we get python for absolute beginners so we get python for absolute beginners so we get python for absolute beginners again this method like the find method again this method like the find method again this method like the find method is case sensitive so if we pass is case sensitive so if we pass is case sensitive so if we pass beginners all in lowercase this method beginners all in lowercase this method beginners all in lowercase this method is not going to find this exact word in is not going to find this exact word in is not going to find this exact word in our string so it's not going to replace our string so it's not going to replace our string so it's not going to replace it with absolute beginners let's take a it with absolute beginners let's take a it with absolute beginners let's take a look so i'm going to run the program one look so i'm going to run the program one look so i'm going to run the program one more time look we still get python for more time look we still get python for more time look we still get python for beginners we can also replace a single beginners we can also replace a single beginners we can also replace a single character for example we can replace character for example we can replace character for example we can replace capital p with capital p with capital p with let's say capital j let's say capital j let's say capital j now when we run this program we get now when we run this program we get now when we run this program we get jython for beginners so these are the jython for beginners so these are the jython for beginners so these are the find and replace method find and replace method find and replace method and one last thing i want to show you in and one last thing i want to show you in and one last thing i want to show you in this tutorial there are times that you this tutorial there are times that you this tutorial there are times that you want to check the existence of a want to check the existence of a want to check the existence of a character or a sequence of characters in character or a sequence of characters in character or a sequence of characters in your string in those situations you use your string in those situations you use your string in those situations you use the in operator so let's say we want to the in operator so let's say we want to the in operator so let's say we want to know if this string contains the word know if this string contains the word know if this string contains the word python we can write an expression like python we can write an expression like python we can write an expression like this this this string python string python string python space space space in space course so we're checking to see in space course so we're checking to see in space course so we're checking to see if python is in the course variable now if python is in the course variable now if python is in the course variable now this is an expression that produces a this is an expression that produces a this is an expression that produces a boolean value like a true or false so we boolean value like a true or false so we boolean value like a true or false so we refer to this expression as a boolean refer to this expression as a boolean refer to this expression as a boolean expression expression expression now if we print this on the terminal now if we print this on the terminal now if we print this on the terminal we should get true and by the way let me we should get true and by the way let me we should get true and by the way let me delete the second line we don't need it delete the second line we don't need it delete the second line we don't need it anymore so run the program we get true anymore so run the program we get true anymore so run the program we get true but if i change this capital p to a but if i change this capital p to a but if i change this capital p to a lowercase p lowercase p lowercase p and run the program we get false because and run the program we get false because and run the program we get false because we don't have this exact sequence of we don't have this exact sequence of we don't have this exact sequence of characters in our string now note that characters in our string now note that characters in our string now note that the difference between the in operator the difference between the in operator the difference between the in operator and define method is that our find and define method is that our find and define method is that our find method returns the index of that method returns the index of that method returns the index of that character or sequence of characters but character or sequence of characters but character or sequence of characters but the in operator produces a boolean value the in operator produces a boolean value the in operator produces a boolean value do we have this or not do we have this or not do we have this or not so that's the difference now let's so that's the difference now let's so that's the difference now let's quickly recap all the cool things you quickly recap all the cool things you quickly recap all the cool things you learn to do with strings in this learn to do with strings in this learn to do with strings in this tutorial tutorial tutorial we can use the len function to count the we can use the len function to count the we can use the len function to count the number of characters in a string this is number of characters in a string this is number of characters in a string this is a general purpose function built into a general purpose function built into a general purpose function built into python we also have specific functions python we also have specific functions python we also have specific functions for strings which we referred to as for strings which we referred to as for strings which we referred to as methods these include methods these include methods these include upper for converting a string into upper for converting a string into upper for converting a string into uppercase we also have lower uppercase we also have lower uppercase we also have lower and title methods and title methods and title methods you learn about the find method which you learn about the find method which you learn about the find method which returns the index of a character or returns the index of a character or returns the index of a character or sequence of characters we have the sequence of characters we have the sequence of characters we have the replace method for replacing characters replace method for replacing characters replace method for replacing characters and words in a string and finally you and words in a string and finally you and words in a string and finally you learned about the in operator so learned about the in operator so learned about the in operator so some characters in some characters in some characters in a string so you have learned that in python so you have learned that in python so you have learned that in python programming language we have two types programming language we have two types programming language we have two types of numbers integers which are whole of numbers integers which are whole of numbers integers which are whole numbers like 10 they don't have a numbers like 10 they don't have a numbers like 10 they don't have a decimal point and floating point numbers decimal point and floating point numbers decimal point and floating point numbers or floats which are numbers with a or floats which are numbers with a or floats which are numbers with a decimal point decimal point decimal point now in this tutorial we're going to look now in this tutorial we're going to look now in this tutorial we're going to look at the arithmetic operations supported at the arithmetic operations supported at the arithmetic operations supported in python language these are the same in python language these are the same in python language these are the same arithmetic operations that we have in arithmetic operations that we have in arithmetic operations that we have in math we can add numbers multiply them math we can add numbers multiply them math we can add numbers multiply them and so on so let's look at a few and so on so let's look at a few and so on so let's look at a few examples we can print examples we can print examples we can print plus 3. plus 3. plus 3. so this is the addition operator we also so this is the addition operator we also so this is the addition operator we also have subtraction we have multiplication have subtraction we have multiplication have subtraction we have multiplication we have two kinds of division here's one we have two kinds of division here's one we have two kinds of division here's one with a forward slash let's run this with a forward slash let's run this with a forward slash let's run this program and see what we get program and see what we get program and see what we get we get a floating point number but we we get a floating point number but we we get a floating point number but we also have another division operator for also have another division operator for also have another division operator for getting an integer so getting an integer so getting an integer so if we add another slash here and run if we add another slash here and run if we add another slash here and run this program this program this program we get an integer we get an integer we get an integer we have another operator called modulus we have another operator called modulus we have another operator called modulus which is a percent sign and this returns which is a percent sign and this returns which is a percent sign and this returns the remainder of the division so when we the remainder of the division so when we the remainder of the division so when we run this program we should get 1. run this program we should get 1. run this program we should get 1. there you go there you go there you go and one last operator we have here is and one last operator we have here is and one last operator we have here is exponent which is the power exponent which is the power exponent which is the power so that is indicated with two asterisks so that is indicated with two asterisks so that is indicated with two asterisks and this will return 10 to the power of and this will return 10 to the power of and this will return 10 to the power of three so let's run this program we get a three so let's run this program we get a three so let's run this program we get a thousand thousand thousand so these are the arithmetic operators in so these are the arithmetic operators in so these are the arithmetic operators in python programming language now for all python programming language now for all python programming language now for all these operators that you learned we have these operators that you learned we have these operators that you learned we have an augmented assignment operator that is an augmented assignment operator that is an augmented assignment operator that is very useful let me show you so very useful let me show you so very useful let me show you so let's say we have a variable called x we let's say we have a variable called x we let's say we have a variable called x we set it to 10. now we want to increment set it to 10. now we want to increment set it to 10. now we want to increment this by three we'll have to write code this by three we'll have to write code this by three we'll have to write code like this x we set this to x plus three like this x we set this to x plus three like this x we set this to x plus three so python interpreter will add 10 to so python interpreter will add 10 to so python interpreter will add 10 to three the result is 13 and then it gets three the result is 13 and then it gets three the result is 13 and then it gets stored into x again so when we print x stored into x again so when we print x stored into x again so when we print x we should see we should see we should see 13. there you go 13. there you go 13. there you go so this is how we can increment a number so this is how we can increment a number so this is how we can increment a number right now augmented assignment operator right now augmented assignment operator right now augmented assignment operator is a way to write the same code but in a is a way to write the same code but in a is a way to write the same code but in a shorter form this is how it works shorter form this is how it works shorter form this is how it works we type x we type x we type x plus equals three what we have on line plus equals three what we have on line plus equals three what we have on line three is exactly like what we have on three is exactly like what we have on three is exactly like what we have on line two line two line two so this is what we call the augmented so this is what we call the augmented so this is what we call the augmented assignment operator we have augmented or assignment operator we have augmented or assignment operator we have augmented or enhanced the assignment operator enhanced the assignment operator enhanced the assignment operator now in this particular case we are now in this particular case we are now in this particular case we are incrementing a number using the incrementing a number using the incrementing a number using the augmented assignment operator but we can augmented assignment operator but we can augmented assignment operator but we can also subtract or multiply a number by a also subtract or multiply a number by a also subtract or multiply a number by a given value for example let's delete given value for example let's delete given value for example let's delete what we have on line two what we have on line two what we have on line two we can type we can type we can type subtract equal three so here we are subtract equal three so here we are subtract equal three so here we are subtracting three from x subtracting three from x subtracting three from x when we run this program we should see when we run this program we should see when we run this program we should see seven seven seven there you go now let me ask you a question now let me ask you a question now let me ask you a question i'm going to clear all this code here i'm going to clear all this code here i'm going to clear all this code here define x and set it to 10 define x and set it to 10 define x and set it to 10 plus 3 times 2. what do you think is the plus 3 times 2. what do you think is the plus 3 times 2. what do you think is the result of this expression this is a very result of this expression this is a very result of this expression this is a very basic math question that unfortunately a basic math question that unfortunately a basic math question that unfortunately a lot of people fail to answer lot of people fail to answer lot of people fail to answer the answer is 16. because in math we the answer is 16. because in math we the answer is 16. because in math we have this concept called operator have this concept called operator have this concept called operator precedence which means the order of precedence which means the order of precedence which means the order of operations operations operations so the multiplication operator has a so the multiplication operator has a so the multiplication operator has a higher precedence so it's applied first higher precedence so it's applied first higher precedence so it's applied first which means three by two is executed which means three by two is executed which means three by two is executed first the result is six and then it's first the result is six and then it's first the result is six and then it's added to 10. that is why x should be 16 added to 10. that is why x should be 16 added to 10. that is why x should be 16 after we run this code let's verify that after we run this code let's verify that after we run this code let's verify that so print x run the program x is 16. so print x run the program x is 16. so print x run the program x is 16. so this is what we call operator so this is what we call operator so this is what we call operator precedence it's just a basic math precedence it's just a basic math precedence it's just a basic math concept it's not about python concept it's not about python concept it's not about python programming language so all the other programming language so all the other programming language so all the other programming languages behave the same programming languages behave the same programming languages behave the same way way way so here's the order first we have the so here's the order first we have the so here's the order first we have the exponentiation which is the power like 2 exponentiation which is the power like 2 exponentiation which is the power like 2 to the power of 3 then we have to the power of 3 then we have to the power of 3 then we have multiplication multiplication multiplication or or or division division division and finally we have addition or and finally we have addition or and finally we have addition or subtraction subtraction subtraction this is the order of operations let me this is the order of operations let me this is the order of operations let me show you another example here i'm going show you another example here i'm going show you another example here i'm going to add to add to add the exponentiation operator so the exponentiation operator so the exponentiation operator so 2 to the power of 2. once again what do 2 to the power of 2. once again what do 2 to the power of 2. once again what do you think is the result of this you think is the result of this you think is the result of this expression pause the video and think expression pause the video and think expression pause the video and think about it for a few seconds about it for a few seconds about it for a few seconds the answer is 22 the answer is 22 the answer is 22 because the exponentiation operator because the exponentiation operator because the exponentiation operator takes precedence so first 2 to the power takes precedence so first 2 to the power takes precedence so first 2 to the power of 2 is executed the result is 4. then 4 of 2 is executed the result is 4. then 4 of 2 is executed the result is 4. then 4 is multiplied by 3 is multiplied by 3 is multiplied by 3 that is 12 and finally 12 is added to that is 12 and finally 12 is added to that is 12 and finally 12 is added to 10. so x should be 22. 10. so x should be 22. 10. so x should be 22. so let's run this program and verify so let's run this program and verify so let's run this program and verify this so i'm going to delete these lines this so i'm going to delete these lines this so i'm going to delete these lines here here here run the program there you go x is 22. run the program there you go x is 22. run the program there you go x is 22. now let me bring back these rules here now let me bring back these rules here now let me bring back these rules here we can also use parentheses to change we can also use parentheses to change we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations so if we have the order of operations so if we have the order of operations so if we have parenthesis parenthesis parenthesis it always takes priority it always takes priority it always takes priority in this case we can add parenthesis in this case we can add parenthesis in this case we can add parenthesis around 10 plus 3 so this piece of code around 10 plus 3 so this piece of code around 10 plus 3 so this piece of code will be executed first the result is 13 will be executed first the result is 13 will be executed first the result is 13 then the exponentiation operator will be then the exponentiation operator will be then the exponentiation operator will be executed so 2 to the power of 2 is 4 and executed so 2 to the power of 2 is 4 and executed so 2 to the power of 2 is 4 and finally 4 is multiplied by 13. finally 4 is multiplied by 13. finally 4 is multiplied by 13. now here's a little exercise for you now here's a little exercise for you now here's a little exercise for you i'm going to set x to parenthesis 2 plus i'm going to set x to parenthesis 2 plus i'm going to set x to parenthesis 2 plus 3 times 10 minus 3. what is the result 3 times 10 minus 3. what is the result 3 times 10 minus 3. what is the result of this pause the video and think about of this pause the video and think about of this pause the video and think about it for a few seconds so you learn that parenthesis always so you learn that parenthesis always so you learn that parenthesis always overwrites the order so this piece of overwrites the order so this piece of overwrites the order so this piece of code is executed first the result is 5. code is executed first the result is 5. code is executed first the result is 5. then between the multiplication and then between the multiplication and then between the multiplication and subtraction you know that multiplication subtraction you know that multiplication subtraction you know that multiplication takes precedence so next 5 will be takes precedence so next 5 will be takes precedence so next 5 will be multiplied by 10 the result is 50 and multiplied by 10 the result is 50 and multiplied by 10 the result is 50 and finally we have the subtraction so 50 finally we have the subtraction so 50 finally we have the subtraction so 50 minus 3 will be 47. let's verify this minus 3 will be 47. let's verify this minus 3 will be 47. let's verify this print x print x print x run the program there you go i hope you run the program there you go i hope you run the program there you go i hope you guessed it right guessed it right guessed it right so this is all about operator precedence so this is all about operator precedence so this is all about operator precedence it's a very important topic and i see it it's a very important topic and i see it it's a very important topic and i see it quite often in python tests so if you're quite often in python tests so if you're quite often in python tests so if you're preparing for a python test make sure to preparing for a python test make sure to preparing for a python test make sure to watch this tutorial one more time in this tutorial we're going to look at in this tutorial we're going to look at in this tutorial we're going to look at a few useful functions for working with a few useful functions for working with a few useful functions for working with numbers let's start by defining a numbers let's start by defining a numbers let's start by defining a variable like x and set it to variable like x and set it to variable like x and set it to 2.9 now to round this number we can use 2.9 now to round this number we can use 2.9 now to round this number we can use the built-in round function so we call the built-in round function so we call the built-in round function so we call the round function give it x and then the round function give it x and then the round function give it x and then print the result let's run this program print the result let's run this program print the result let's run this program so we get three we have another useful so we get three we have another useful so we get three we have another useful built-in function called abs which is built-in function called abs which is built-in function called abs which is short for absolute and this is the short for absolute and this is the short for absolute and this is the absolute function that we have in math absolute function that we have in math absolute function that we have in math we give it a value and it always returns we give it a value and it always returns we give it a value and it always returns the positive representation of that the positive representation of that the positive representation of that value even if that value is negative value even if that value is negative value even if that value is negative here's an example let's call here's an example let's call here's an example let's call the abs function and give it negative the abs function and give it negative the abs function and give it negative 2.9 when we run this program we're going 2.9 when we run this program we're going 2.9 when we run this program we're going to see 2.9 on the terminal so let's go to see 2.9 on the terminal so let's go to see 2.9 on the terminal so let's go ahead there you go so absolute always ahead there you go so absolute always ahead there you go so absolute always returns a positive number now returns a positive number now returns a positive number now technically in python we have a handful technically in python we have a handful technically in python we have a handful of built-in functions for performing of built-in functions for performing of built-in functions for performing mathematical operations if you want to mathematical operations if you want to mathematical operations if you want to write a program that involves complex write a program that involves complex write a program that involves complex mathematical calculations you need to mathematical calculations you need to mathematical calculations you need to import the math module import the math module import the math module a module in python is a separate file a module in python is a separate file a module in python is a separate file with some reusable code we use these with some reusable code we use these with some reusable code we use these modules to organize our code into modules to organize our code into modules to organize our code into different files as a metaphor think of a different files as a metaphor think of a different files as a metaphor think of a supermarket when you go to a supermarket supermarket when you go to a supermarket supermarket when you go to a supermarket you see different sections for fruits you see different sections for fruits you see different sections for fruits and vegetables cleaning products junk and vegetables cleaning products junk and vegetables cleaning products junk food and so on each section in the food and so on each section in the food and so on each section in the supermarket is like a module in python supermarket is like a module in python supermarket is like a module in python so in python we have this math module so in python we have this math module so in python we have this math module which contains a bunch of reusable which contains a bunch of reusable which contains a bunch of reusable functions for performing mathematical functions for performing mathematical functions for performing mathematical calculations so let me show you how to calculations so let me show you how to calculations so let me show you how to use this module on the top use this module on the top use this module on the top we type we type we type import import import math all in lowercase with this we can math all in lowercase with this we can math all in lowercase with this we can import the math module now math is an import the math module now math is an import the math module now math is an object like a string so we can access object like a string so we can access object like a string so we can access its functions or more accurately its its functions or more accurately its its functions or more accurately its methods using the dot operator so if you methods using the dot operator so if you methods using the dot operator so if you type math dot look these are all the type math dot look these are all the type math dot look these are all the mathematical functions available in this mathematical functions available in this mathematical functions available in this module for example we can call the seal module for example we can call the seal module for example we can call the seal method to get the ceiling of a number so method to get the ceiling of a number so method to get the ceiling of a number so if we pass 2.9 here if we pass 2.9 here if we pass 2.9 here and then print the result we should see and then print the result we should see and then print the result we should see three let me delete all this other code three let me delete all this other code three let me delete all this other code here all right let's run this program here all right let's run this program here all right let's run this program there you go so we get three there you go so we get three there you go so we get three another useful method is the floor another useful method is the floor another useful method is the floor method so let's give that a try floor of method so let's give that a try floor of method so let's give that a try floor of 2.9 what do you think we're gonna get 2.9 what do you think we're gonna get 2.9 what do you think we're gonna get we get two we get two we get two now there's so many functions built in now there's so many functions built in now there's so many functions built in this module and we don't really have this module and we don't really have this module and we don't really have time to go through all of them but let time to go through all of them but let time to go through all of them but let me show you how you can learn about them me show you how you can learn about them me show you how you can learn about them on your own on your own on your own open up your browser and search for open up your browser and search for open up your browser and search for python3 math module make sure to add the python3 math module make sure to add the python3 math module make sure to add the version python3 because the mass module version python3 because the mass module version python3 because the mass module in python 2 is slightly different from in python 2 is slightly different from in python 2 is slightly different from the math module in python 3. the math module in python 3. the math module in python 3. so python 3 math module so python 3 math module so python 3 math module now here you can see the documentation now here you can see the documentation now here you can see the documentation for this module let's go for this module let's go for this module let's go let's have a look if you scroll down you let's have a look if you scroll down you let's have a look if you scroll down you can see the list of all the functions can see the list of all the functions can see the list of all the functions and their explanation and their explanation and their explanation so as an exercise i encourage you to so as an exercise i encourage you to so as an exercise i encourage you to spend five minutes have a quick look at spend five minutes have a quick look at spend five minutes have a quick look at this documentation see what functions this documentation see what functions this documentation see what functions are there for you in case you need them in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about if statements in python you guys about if statements in python you guys about if statements in python if statements are extremely important in if statements are extremely important in if statements are extremely important in programming and they allow us to build programming and they allow us to build programming and they allow us to build programs that can make decisions based programs that can make decisions based programs that can make decisions based on some conditions so if some condition on some conditions so if some condition on some conditions so if some condition is true we're going to do certain things is true we're going to do certain things is true we're going to do certain things otherwise we're going to do other things otherwise we're going to do other things otherwise we're going to do other things here's an example here's an example here's an example over here i've got this text file with a over here i've got this text file with a over here i've got this text file with a bunch of rules for our program bunch of rules for our program bunch of rules for our program if it's a hot day perhaps you want to if it's a hot day perhaps you want to if it's a hot day perhaps you want to tell the user it's a hot day so make tell the user it's a hot day so make tell the user it's a hot day so make sure to drink plenty of water sure to drink plenty of water sure to drink plenty of water otherwise otherwise otherwise if it's cold so here's another condition if it's cold so here's another condition if it's cold so here's another condition if this condition is true we're going to if this condition is true we're going to if this condition is true we're going to tell the user it's a cold day so wear tell the user it's a cold day so wear tell the user it's a cold day so wear warm clothes warm clothes warm clothes and otherwise if it's neither hot or and otherwise if it's neither hot or and otherwise if it's neither hot or cold we want to tell the user it's a cold we want to tell the user it's a cold we want to tell the user it's a lovely day lovely day lovely day so let me show you how to write a so let me show you how to write a so let me show you how to write a program that simulates these rules program that simulates these rules program that simulates these rules so so so back to our program here we start by back to our program here we start by back to our program here we start by defining a boolean variable defining a boolean variable defining a boolean variable is underline hot we set this to true is underline hot we set this to true is underline hot we set this to true next we add an if statement so if next we add an if statement so if next we add an if statement so if here we need to add a condition in this here we need to add a condition in this here we need to add a condition in this case we're going to use our boolean case we're going to use our boolean case we're going to use our boolean variable so is underline hot variable so is underline hot variable so is underline hot now if this evaluates to true then we're now if this evaluates to true then we're now if this evaluates to true then we're going to do certain things in this case going to do certain things in this case going to do certain things in this case we want to tell the user hey it's a hot we want to tell the user hey it's a hot we want to tell the user hey it's a hot day drink plenty of water day drink plenty of water day drink plenty of water so back to our program so back to our program so back to our program after our condition we add a colon after our condition we add a colon after our condition we add a colon now note that when i press enter pycharm now note that when i press enter pycharm now note that when i press enter pycharm automatically indents our cursor automatically indents our cursor automatically indents our cursor now any code that we write here will be now any code that we write here will be now any code that we write here will be executed if this condition is true executed if this condition is true executed if this condition is true otherwise it will be ignored here's an otherwise it will be ignored here's an otherwise it will be ignored here's an example example example let's write a print statement let's write a print statement let's write a print statement here i'm going to use double quotes here i'm going to use double quotes here i'm going to use double quotes because i want to use an apostrophe in because i want to use an apostrophe in because i want to use an apostrophe in our string so our string so our string so it's a hot day it's a hot day it's a hot day now let's press enter you can see the now let's press enter you can see the now let's press enter you can see the cursor is still indented that means we cursor is still indented that means we cursor is still indented that means we can write more code that will be can write more code that will be can write more code that will be executed if this condition is true in executed if this condition is true in executed if this condition is true in this case let's say we don't want to this case let's say we don't want to this case let's say we don't want to write any extra code so to terminate write any extra code so to terminate write any extra code so to terminate this block we need to press shift and this block we need to press shift and this block we need to press shift and tab now the cursor is at the beginning tab now the cursor is at the beginning tab now the cursor is at the beginning of the line so let's write a print of the line so let's write a print of the line so let's write a print statement with a message like enjoy your statement with a message like enjoy your statement with a message like enjoy your day day day now when we run this program because now when we run this program because now when we run this program because this condition is true we're going to this condition is true we're going to this condition is true we're going to see this message followed by the second see this message followed by the second see this message followed by the second message take a look so run message take a look so run message take a look so run there you go it's a hot day enjoy your there you go it's a hot day enjoy your there you go it's a hot day enjoy your day but if i go over here day but if i go over here day but if i go over here and change this boolean value to false and change this boolean value to false and change this boolean value to false and run the program again and run the program again and run the program again our first message disappears and we only our first message disappears and we only our first message disappears and we only see the second message enjoy your day so see the second message enjoy your day so see the second message enjoy your day so this is how if statements work now back this is how if statements work now back this is how if statements work now back here we can add another print statement here we can add another print statement here we can add another print statement let's say let's say let's say drink drink drink plenty plenty plenty of water now because this print of water now because this print of water now because this print statement is also indented it will be statement is also indented it will be statement is also indented it will be executed if this condition is true so executed if this condition is true so executed if this condition is true so i'm going to revert is hot to true and i'm going to revert is hot to true and i'm going to revert is hot to true and run the program one more time run the program one more time run the program one more time there you go so it's a hot day drink there you go so it's a hot day drink there you go so it's a hot day drink plenty of water and enjoy your day plenty of water and enjoy your day plenty of water and enjoy your day all right now let's add a second rule all right now let's add a second rule all right now let's add a second rule here if it's hot we're going to execute here if it's hot we're going to execute here if it's hot we're going to execute these two lines otherwise if it's not these two lines otherwise if it's not these two lines otherwise if it's not hot we want to print a different message hot we want to print a different message hot we want to print a different message so here so here so here we remove the indentation we remove the indentation we remove the indentation and type else and type else and type else colon colon colon now when we press enter now when we press enter now when we press enter once again our cursor is indented so the once again our cursor is indented so the once again our cursor is indented so the code that we write here will be executed code that we write here will be executed code that we write here will be executed if this condition is not true if this condition is not true if this condition is not true so here we can print so here we can print so here we can print it's a cold day it's a cold day it's a cold day print print print wear wear wear warm clothes warm clothes warm clothes now let's run our program one more time now let's run our program one more time now let's run our program one more time so we get the messages about a hot day so we get the messages about a hot day so we get the messages about a hot day followed by enjoy your day we don't see followed by enjoy your day we don't see followed by enjoy your day we don't see any messages about a cold day now if we any messages about a cold day now if we any messages about a cold day now if we go back here on the top go back here on the top go back here on the top and and and change this boolean value to false and change this boolean value to false and change this boolean value to false and run our program run our program run our program we see different set of messages it's a we see different set of messages it's a we see different set of messages it's a cold day wear warm clothes and enjoy cold day wear warm clothes and enjoy cold day wear warm clothes and enjoy your day your day your day but there's a problem with our program but there's a problem with our program but there's a problem with our program if it's not hot it doesn't necessarily if it's not hot it doesn't necessarily if it's not hot it doesn't necessarily mean that it's cold maybe it's a lovely mean that it's cold maybe it's a lovely mean that it's cold maybe it's a lovely day so the absence of heat doesn't mean day so the absence of heat doesn't mean day so the absence of heat doesn't mean it's cold it's cold it's cold back to our conditions back to our conditions back to our conditions here on line four we have this rule that here on line four we have this rule that here on line four we have this rule that says if it's a cold day then print these says if it's a cold day then print these says if it's a cold day then print these messages otherwise if it's neither hot messages otherwise if it's neither hot messages otherwise if it's neither hot or cold then say it's a lovely day so to or cold then say it's a lovely day so to or cold then say it's a lovely day so to implement this rule we need to go back implement this rule we need to go back implement this rule we need to go back to after pi to after pi to after pi and define another variable so and define another variable so and define another variable so let's say is underline called let's say is underline called let's say is underline called we set this to we set this to we set this to true true true now here we need to add a second now here we need to add a second now here we need to add a second condition so after condition so after condition so after our first if statement we can use an our first if statement we can use an our first if statement we can use an elif statement to define a second elif statement to define a second elif statement to define a second condition here's how it works condition here's how it works condition here's how it works so l if which is short for else if or so l if which is short for else if or so l if which is short for else if or otherwise if now here we add another otherwise if now here we add another otherwise if now here we add another condition so is called condition so is called condition so is called so if it's cold you want to execute so if it's cold you want to execute so if it's cold you want to execute these two lines these two lines these two lines so let's cut these from here and move so let's cut these from here and move so let's cut these from here and move them them them under our second condition under our second condition under our second condition and finally if none of these conditions and finally if none of these conditions and finally if none of these conditions are true you want to print a different are true you want to print a different are true you want to print a different message message message it's a lovely day it's a lovely day it's a lovely day so so so right now right now right now is hot is false is cold it's true so is hot is false is cold it's true so is hot is false is cold it's true so when we run this program python when we run this program python when we run this program python interpreter is going to execute the interpreter is going to execute the interpreter is going to execute the first if statement in this case because first if statement in this case because first if statement in this case because our condition is false these two lines our condition is false these two lines our condition is false these two lines will be ignored then python interpreter will be ignored then python interpreter will be ignored then python interpreter will look at line seven it will evaluate will look at line seven it will evaluate will look at line seven it will evaluate this condition in this case is called is this condition in this case is called is this condition in this case is called is true so we're going to see these two true so we're going to see these two true so we're going to see these two messages on the terminal messages on the terminal messages on the terminal now in this case because one of these now in this case because one of these now in this case because one of these conditions was true this else statement conditions was true this else statement conditions was true this else statement will be ignored so we are not going to will be ignored so we are not going to will be ignored so we are not going to see this message and finally as before see this message and finally as before see this message and finally as before we are always going to see this message we are always going to see this message we are always going to see this message so let's run our program there you go so let's run our program there you go so let's run our program there you go it's a cold day it's a cold day it's a cold day wear warm clothes and enjoy your day wear warm clothes and enjoy your day wear warm clothes and enjoy your day now now now back to the top if we change is cold to back to the top if we change is cold to back to the top if we change is cold to false false false it's neither hot nor cold so it's going it's neither hot nor cold so it's going it's neither hot nor cold so it's going to be a lovely day let's run the program to be a lovely day let's run the program to be a lovely day let's run the program and and and here you go it's a lovely day enjoy your here you go it's a lovely day enjoy your here you go it's a lovely day enjoy your day day day so this is the basic of using ip so this is the basic of using ip so this is the basic of using ip statements as you can see they're very statements as you can see they're very statements as you can see they're very useful in programming and with this we useful in programming and with this we useful in programming and with this we can build all kinds of rules into our can build all kinds of rules into our can build all kinds of rules into our programs programs programs okay here's an exercise for you imagine okay here's an exercise for you imagine okay here's an exercise for you imagine the price of a house is one million the price of a house is one million the price of a house is one million dollars now if the buyer has good credit dollars now if the buyer has good credit dollars now if the buyer has good credit they need to put down 10 they need to put down 10 they need to put down 10 of the price of this property otherwise of the price of this property otherwise of the price of this property otherwise they need to put down 20 they need to put down 20 they need to put down 20 write your program with these rules and write your program with these rules and write your program with these rules and display the down payment required for a display the down payment required for a display the down payment required for a buyer with good credit you will see my buyer with good credit you will see my buyer with good credit you will see my solution next all right let's define a variable for all right let's define a variable for all right let's define a variable for the price of this house so price we set the price of this house so price we set the price of this house so price we set this to 1 million so one with six zeros this to 1 million so one with six zeros this to 1 million so one with six zeros next we need a variable to tell if this next we need a variable to tell if this next we need a variable to tell if this buyer has good credit buyer has good credit buyer has good credit so has so has so has good good good credit and we set this to true credit and we set this to true credit and we set this to true now we need an if statement so now we need an if statement so now we need an if statement so if has if has if has good credit is true good credit is true good credit is true colon colon colon here we need to calculate the down here we need to calculate the down here we need to calculate the down payment so down underline payment payment so down underline payment payment so down underline payment should be equal to 0.1 times the price should be equal to 0.1 times the price should be equal to 0.1 times the price that is 10 that is 10 that is 10 of the price of this property of the price of this property of the price of this property otherwise otherwise otherwise colon colon colon the down payment should be the down payment should be the down payment should be 0.2 0.2 0.2 times price times price times price and finally we remove the indentation and finally we remove the indentation and finally we remove the indentation and print and print and print here we can use a formatted string here we can use a formatted string here we can use a formatted string first we add a label first we add a label first we add a label down payment colon and right after that down payment colon and right after that down payment colon and right after that we add a placeholder or a hole for our we add a placeholder or a hole for our we add a placeholder or a hole for our down payment variable so down payment variable so down payment variable so curly braces curly braces curly braces down payment down payment down payment let's run this program let's run this program let's run this program so down payment for a buyer with good so down payment for a buyer with good so down payment for a buyer with good credit is 100 000 credit is 100 000 credit is 100 000 now let's improve this by adding a now let's improve this by adding a now let's improve this by adding a dollar sign before this number so dollar sign before this number so dollar sign before this number so back to our formatted string just before back to our formatted string just before back to our formatted string just before the curly brace the curly brace the curly brace i'm going to add a dollar sign let's run i'm going to add a dollar sign let's run i'm going to add a dollar sign let's run this one more time that is better in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about the logical operators in you guys about the logical operators in you guys about the logical operators in python we use these operators in python we use these operators in python we use these operators in situations where we have multiple situations where we have multiple situations where we have multiple conditions here's an example conditions here's an example conditions here's an example let's say we're building an application let's say we're building an application let's say we're building an application for processing loans if an applicant has for processing loans if an applicant has for processing loans if an applicant has high income high income high income and good credit then they're eligible and good credit then they're eligible and good credit then they're eligible for loan so in this example we have two for loan so in this example we have two for loan so in this example we have two conditions one is having high income and conditions one is having high income and conditions one is having high income and the other is having good credit so if the other is having good credit so if the other is having good credit so if both these conditions are true then the both these conditions are true then the both these conditions are true then the applicant is eligible for loan so this applicant is eligible for loan so this applicant is eligible for loan so this is where we use the logical is where we use the logical is where we use the logical and operator we use this operator to and operator we use this operator to and operator we use this operator to combine two conditions and by the way combine two conditions and by the way combine two conditions and by the way this is not specific to python this is not specific to python this is not specific to python programming language pretty much any programming language pretty much any programming language pretty much any programming language that supports if programming language that supports if programming language that supports if statements also supports the logical statements also supports the logical statements also supports the logical operators so back to our program let's operators so back to our program let's operators so back to our program let's define two variables define two variables define two variables has high income has high income has high income we set this to true we set this to true we set this to true and another one has and another one has and another one has good good good credit we also set this to true credit we also set this to true credit we also set this to true now our if statement if now our if statement if now our if statement if has high income is true has high income is true has high income is true and and and has has has good credit is also true good credit is also true good credit is also true then then then we're going to print we're going to print we're going to print eligible eligible eligible for loan for loan for loan so this is where we're using the and so this is where we're using the and so this is where we're using the and operator operator operator so if both these conditions are true so if both these conditions are true so if both these conditions are true then this message will be printed if one then this message will be printed if one then this message will be printed if one of them is false we're not going to see of them is false we're not going to see of them is false we're not going to see this message let's try this out so i'm this message let's try this out so i'm this message let's try this out so i'm going to run this program going to run this program going to run this program so we see eligible for loan but if we so we see eligible for loan but if we so we see eligible for loan but if we change change change either of these conditions to false either of these conditions to false either of these conditions to false and run the program again and run the program again and run the program again look the message disappeared so this is look the message disappeared so this is look the message disappeared so this is the logical and operator we also have the logical and operator we also have the logical and operator we also have the logical or and we use that in the logical or and we use that in the logical or and we use that in situations where we want to do certain situations where we want to do certain situations where we want to do certain things if at least one of the conditions things if at least one of the conditions things if at least one of the conditions is true for example let's change is true for example let's change is true for example let's change the rule for this program such that the rule for this program such that the rule for this program such that if the applicant has high income if the applicant has high income if the applicant has high income or good credit then they're eligible for or good credit then they're eligible for or good credit then they're eligible for loan loan loan so if either or both these conditions so if either or both these conditions so if either or both these conditions are true then the applicant is eligible are true then the applicant is eligible are true then the applicant is eligible now now now back to our program we can implement back to our program we can implement back to our program we can implement this rule by using the logical or this rule by using the logical or this rule by using the logical or operator so we simply replace operator so we simply replace operator so we simply replace and with or and with or and with or now when we run this program we're going now when we run this program we're going now when we run this program we're going to see this message because at least one to see this message because at least one to see this message because at least one of our conditions is true of our conditions is true of our conditions is true let's take a look let's take a look let's take a look so the applicant is eligible for loan so the applicant is eligible for loan so the applicant is eligible for loan because they have good credit if we because they have good credit if we because they have good credit if we change this to false change this to false change this to false but set the other condition to true but set the other condition to true but set the other condition to true and run the program we still see the and run the program we still see the and run the program we still see the same result but if both these conditions same result but if both these conditions same result but if both these conditions are false are false are false then we're not going to see this message then we're not going to see this message then we're not going to see this message anymore anymore anymore so this is the difference between these so this is the difference between these so this is the difference between these operators with the logical and operator operators with the logical and operator operators with the logical and operator both conditions both conditions both conditions should be true should be true should be true with the logical or operator at least with the logical or operator at least with the logical or operator at least one condition should be true one condition should be true one condition should be true we also have another logical operator we also have another logical operator we also have another logical operator called not and that basically inverses called not and that basically inverses called not and that basically inverses any boolean value we give it if we give any boolean value we give it if we give any boolean value we give it if we give it a true boolean value it converts it it a true boolean value it converts it it a true boolean value it converts it to false for example let's make up a new to false for example let's make up a new to false for example let's make up a new rule rule rule if applicant if applicant if applicant has good credit has good credit has good credit and doesn't have and doesn't have and doesn't have a criminal a criminal a criminal record record record then they're eligible for a loan let me then they're eligible for a loan let me then they're eligible for a loan let me show you how to implement this so we go show you how to implement this so we go show you how to implement this so we go back to our program back to our program back to our program in this example we don't need the first in this example we don't need the first in this example we don't need the first variable so let's delete that let's set variable so let's delete that let's set variable so let's delete that let's set this variable to true this variable to true this variable to true we also define another variable like has we also define another variable like has we also define another variable like has criminal criminal criminal record record record and we set this to false and we set this to false and we set this to false now we want to check to see if this now we want to check to see if this now we want to check to see if this applicant has good credit and not a applicant has good credit and not a applicant has good credit and not a criminal record this is where we use the criminal record this is where we use the criminal record this is where we use the nut operator so nut operator so nut operator so if they have good credit if they have good credit if they have good credit and and and not not not criminal criminal criminal record record record so in this example so in this example so in this example has criminal record is set to false when has criminal record is set to false when has criminal record is set to false when we use the not operator this basically we use the not operator this basically we use the not operator this basically gets changed to true so we'll have two gets changed to true so we'll have two gets changed to true so we'll have two conditions that are true here's one and conditions that are true here's one and conditions that are true here's one and here's another one so our applicant is here's another one so our applicant is here's another one so our applicant is eligible for loan eligible for loan eligible for loan and when we run this program we see and when we run this program we see and when we run this program we see this familiar message this familiar message this familiar message however however however if an applicant has criminal record so if an applicant has criminal record so if an applicant has criminal record so let's change this to true let's change this to true let's change this to true now when we run this program we can see now when we run this program we can see now when we run this program we can see our applicant is not eligible because our applicant is not eligible because our applicant is not eligible because when we apply the not operator on this when we apply the not operator on this when we apply the not operator on this variable variable variable will get false so true changes to false will get false so true changes to false will get false so true changes to false and will end up with two conditions one and will end up with two conditions one and will end up with two conditions one is true and the other is false so the is true and the other is false so the is true and the other is false so the result is false and that's why this result is false and that's why this result is false and that's why this message is not printed message is not printed message is not printed so this is all about the logical so this is all about the logical so this is all about the logical operators in python in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about the comparison operators you guys about the comparison operators you guys about the comparison operators in python we use comparison operators in in python we use comparison operators in in python we use comparison operators in situations where we want to compare a situations where we want to compare a situations where we want to compare a variable with a value for example if variable with a value for example if variable with a value for example if temperature is greater than 30 then we temperature is greater than 30 then we temperature is greater than 30 then we want to print it's a hot day want to print it's a hot day want to print it's a hot day otherwise if it's less than 10 it's a otherwise if it's less than 10 it's a otherwise if it's less than 10 it's a cold day cold day cold day otherwise it's neither hot nor cold and otherwise it's neither hot nor cold and otherwise it's neither hot nor cold and by the way here i'm talking about by the way here i'm talking about by the way here i'm talking about celsius not fahrenheit so to build these celsius not fahrenheit so to build these celsius not fahrenheit so to build these rules into our program we need to use rules into our program we need to use rules into our program we need to use comparison operators comparison operators comparison operators back to app.pi back to app.pi back to app.pi i'll define this temperature variable i'll define this temperature variable i'll define this temperature variable let's write an if statement if let's write an if statement if let's write an if statement if temperature temperature temperature now we want to check to see if this is now we want to check to see if this is now we want to check to see if this is greater than 30. so we use the greater greater than 30. so we use the greater greater than 30. so we use the greater than operator if this is greater than 30 than operator if this is greater than 30 than operator if this is greater than 30 we want to print we want to print we want to print it's a hot it's a hot it's a hot day day day otherwise otherwise otherwise let's just print it's let's just print it's let's just print it's not a hot day not a hot day not a hot day now when we run this program we're going now when we run this program we're going now when we run this program we're going to see the second message because 30 is to see the second message because 30 is to see the second message because 30 is not greater than 30. so our first not greater than 30. so our first not greater than 30. so our first condition condition condition evaluates to false evaluates to false evaluates to false let's verify that's a run let's verify that's a run let's verify that's a run it's not a hot day okay it's not a hot day okay it's not a hot day okay now if we change the temperature to 35 now if we change the temperature to 35 now if we change the temperature to 35 and run this again and run this again and run this again we're going to see a different message we're going to see a different message we're going to see a different message it's a hot day so this is where we use it's a hot day so this is where we use it's a hot day so this is where we use comparison operators now what we have comparison operators now what we have comparison operators now what we have here as you know is an expression here as you know is an expression here as you know is an expression because it's a piece of code that because it's a piece of code that because it's a piece of code that produces a value so more accurately this produces a value so more accurately this produces a value so more accurately this is a boolean expression is a boolean expression is a boolean expression so this is the greater than operator we so this is the greater than operator we so this is the greater than operator we also have greater than or equal to also have greater than or equal to also have greater than or equal to we have less than we have less than we have less than less than or equal to less than or equal to less than or equal to here's the equality operator so if the here's the equality operator so if the here's the equality operator so if the temperature equals to 30 then we can say temperature equals to 30 then we can say temperature equals to 30 then we can say it's a hot day note that this is it's a hot day note that this is it's a hot day note that this is different from the assignment operator different from the assignment operator different from the assignment operator that has only one equal sign you can see that has only one equal sign you can see that has only one equal sign you can see if we use one equal sign here we if we use one equal sign here we if we use one equal sign here we immediately get this red underline immediately get this red underline immediately get this red underline because this is simply an assignment because this is simply an assignment because this is simply an assignment statement we're changing the value of statement we're changing the value of statement we're changing the value of the temperature we're setting the value the temperature we're setting the value the temperature we're setting the value of the temperature variable to 30. we're of the temperature variable to 30. we're of the temperature variable to 30. we're not comparing it with something else so not comparing it with something else so not comparing it with something else so we don't have a boolean expression we're we don't have a boolean expression we're we don't have a boolean expression we're not producing a boolean value okay so not producing a boolean value okay so not producing a boolean value okay so our equality operator has two equal our equality operator has two equal our equality operator has two equal signs and finally we have not equal signs and finally we have not equal signs and finally we have not equal which is an exclamation followed by an which is an exclamation followed by an which is an exclamation followed by an equal sign equal sign equal sign now here's an exercise for you you've now here's an exercise for you you've now here's an exercise for you you've probably seen that when you fill out a probably seen that when you fill out a probably seen that when you fill out a form online sometimes the input fields form online sometimes the input fields form online sometimes the input fields have validation messages for example have validation messages for example have validation messages for example let's say we have an input field for the let's say we have an input field for the let's say we have an input field for the user to enter their name now if the name user to enter their name now if the name user to enter their name now if the name is less than three characters long we is less than three characters long we is less than three characters long we want to display a validation error like want to display a validation error like want to display a validation error like name must be at least 3 characters name must be at least 3 characters name must be at least 3 characters otherwise if the name is more than 50 otherwise if the name is more than 50 otherwise if the name is more than 50 characters long then we want to display characters long then we want to display characters long then we want to display a different validation error like name a different validation error like name a different validation error like name can be a maximum of 50 characters can be a maximum of 50 characters can be a maximum of 50 characters otherwise if the name is between 3 and otherwise if the name is between 3 and otherwise if the name is between 3 and 50 characters 50 characters 50 characters then we just want to tell the user that then we just want to tell the user that then we just want to tell the user that name looks good name looks good name looks good so go ahead and write a program to so go ahead and write a program to so go ahead and write a program to implement these rules all right let's define a variable called all right let's define a variable called all right let's define a variable called name and set it to let's say j so we're name and set it to let's say j so we're name and set it to let's say j so we're assuming this is what the user types assuming this is what the user types assuming this is what the user types into an input field into an input field into an input field now we want to get the number of now we want to get the number of now we want to get the number of characters in this string so we use the characters in this string so we use the characters in this string so we use the len function right len function right len function right lan of name lan of name lan of name when we print this when we print this when we print this we get one right you have seen this we get one right you have seen this we get one right you have seen this before now here we want to use an if before now here we want to use an if before now here we want to use an if statement so if len of name statement so if len of name statement so if len of name is less than three is less than three is less than three then then then we want to print we want to print we want to print name must be name must be name must be at least at least at least three characters like here we need a second condition to like here we need a second condition to like here we need a second condition to check the upper limit so l if check the upper limit so l if check the upper limit so l if len of name len of name len of name is greater than 50 is greater than 50 is greater than 50 then we want to print a different then we want to print a different then we want to print a different message name message name message name must be a maximum must be a maximum must be a maximum of 50 of 50 of 50 characters characters characters okay okay okay and otherwise so else if none of these and otherwise so else if none of these and otherwise so else if none of these conditions is true that means the name conditions is true that means the name conditions is true that means the name looks good so print looks good so print looks good so print name looks good let's run our program name looks good let's run our program name looks good let's run our program so in this case we get this message so in this case we get this message so in this case we get this message because our name is too short because our name is too short because our name is too short if you go back here if you go back here if you go back here and and and type something really really long type something really really long type something really really long and then run our program and then run our program and then run our program we're going to see a different message we're going to see a different message we're going to see a different message name must be a maximum of 50 characters name must be a maximum of 50 characters name must be a maximum of 50 characters and finally and finally and finally if we type a proper name here like john if we type a proper name here like john if we type a proper name here like john smith smith smith and run our program and run our program and run our program we get name looks good here's another good exercise that here's another good exercise that here's another good exercise that combines many of the materials you have combines many of the materials you have combines many of the materials you have learned so far so earlier you built a learned so far so earlier you built a learned so far so earlier you built a program to convert someone's weight from program to convert someone's weight from program to convert someone's weight from pounds to kilograms now we want to pounds to kilograms now we want to pounds to kilograms now we want to extend this program and allow the user extend this program and allow the user extend this program and allow the user to enter their weight in either to enter their weight in either to enter their weight in either kilograms or pounds and then we'll kilograms or pounds and then we'll kilograms or pounds and then we'll convert it to the other unit here's how convert it to the other unit here's how convert it to the other unit here's how our program is going to work so i enter our program is going to work so i enter our program is going to work so i enter my weight in pounds so 160. my weight in pounds so 160. my weight in pounds so 160. now it's telling me is this in pounds or now it's telling me is this in pounds or now it's telling me is this in pounds or kilograms so here i need to enter l for kilograms so here i need to enter l for kilograms so here i need to enter l for pounds or k for kilograms and by the way pounds or k for kilograms and by the way pounds or k for kilograms and by the way this program is not case sensitive so this program is not case sensitive so this program is not case sensitive so whether i enter a capital l or a whether i enter a capital l or a whether i enter a capital l or a lowercase l it takes it as pounds lowercase l it takes it as pounds lowercase l it takes it as pounds now it tells me you are 72 kilos now it tells me you are 72 kilos now it tells me you are 72 kilos let's run this program one more time let's run this program one more time let's run this program one more time this time i'm going to enter my weight this time i'm going to enter my weight this time i'm going to enter my weight in kilos so in kilos so in kilos so 72 is the weight 72 is the weight 72 is the weight and the unit is kilograms okay and the unit is kilograms okay and the unit is kilograms okay and it says you are 160 pounds so go and it says you are 160 pounds so go and it says you are 160 pounds so go ahead and spend a few minutes on this ahead and spend a few minutes on this ahead and spend a few minutes on this exercise you will see my solution next all right first let's ask the user their all right first let's ask the user their all right first let's ask the user their weight so we use the input function weight so we use the input function weight so we use the input function weight colon weight colon weight colon we get the return value and store it in we get the return value and store it in we get the return value and store it in a variable called weight now the second a variable called weight now the second a variable called weight now the second question question question so one more time we use the input so one more time we use the input so one more time we use the input function function function l for pounds l for pounds l for pounds lps or lps or lps or k k k for kilograms for kilograms for kilograms so let's get that 2 and store it in a so let's get that 2 and store it in a so let's get that 2 and store it in a variable called unit variable called unit variable called unit now we need an if statement so if now we need an if statement so if now we need an if statement so if unit unit unit equals l equals l equals l then we need to convert this weight into then we need to convert this weight into then we need to convert this weight into kilograms however with this kilograms however with this kilograms however with this implementation we are only allowing the implementation we are only allowing the implementation we are only allowing the user to enter a capital l if they enter user to enter a capital l if they enter user to enter a capital l if they enter a lowercase l this code is not going to a lowercase l this code is not going to a lowercase l this code is not going to work work work so this is where we use the upper method so this is where we use the upper method so this is where we use the upper method of string objects so this unit is a of string objects so this unit is a of string objects so this unit is a string because as i told you before the string because as i told you before the string because as i told you before the input function always returns a string input function always returns a string input function always returns a string so we can use the dot operator to access so we can use the dot operator to access so we can use the dot operator to access all its methods or functions here we all its methods or functions here we all its methods or functions here we call the upper method this will convert call the upper method this will convert call the upper method this will convert whatever the user enters to uppercase whatever the user enters to uppercase whatever the user enters to uppercase and then we'll compare it with a capital and then we'll compare it with a capital and then we'll compare it with a capital l l l now if this condition is true now if this condition is true now if this condition is true then we need to get the weight and then we need to get the weight and then we need to get the weight and multiply it by 0.45 multiply it by 0.45 multiply it by 0.45 however as you know this weight is a however as you know this weight is a however as you know this weight is a string object and we cannot multiply a string object and we cannot multiply a string object and we cannot multiply a string by a floating point number we string by a floating point number we string by a floating point number we talked about this earlier in this course talked about this earlier in this course talked about this earlier in this course so first we need to convert this weight so first we need to convert this weight so first we need to convert this weight to a numerical value to a numerical value to a numerical value so right here when we call the input so right here when we call the input so right here when we call the input function we can get the return value and function we can get the return value and function we can get the return value and pass it to the int function pass it to the int function pass it to the int function so we call the in function so we call the in function so we call the in function and and and give it the return value of the input give it the return value of the input give it the return value of the input function function function now the in function will return an now the in function will return an now the in function will return an integer so we can store it in this integer so we can store it in this integer so we can store it in this weight variable weight variable weight variable so here's the converted weight let's so here's the converted weight let's so here's the converted weight let's store it in a variable called converted store it in a variable called converted store it in a variable called converted then we print then we print then we print here we can use a formatted string so here we can use a formatted string so here we can use a formatted string so we prefix the string with f we prefix the string with f we prefix the string with f u r u r u r we add curly braces we add curly braces we add curly braces to dynamically insert the value of to dynamically insert the value of to dynamically insert the value of converted variable converted variable converted variable and finally we add kilos and finally we add kilos and finally we add kilos otherwise otherwise otherwise if the unit is kilogram we need to if the unit is kilogram we need to if the unit is kilogram we need to divide the weight by divide the weight by divide the weight by 0.45 0.45 0.45 so once again we type converted equals so once again we type converted equals so once again we type converted equals to to to weight divided by weight divided by weight divided by 0.45 and just to refresh our memory this 0.45 and just to refresh our memory this 0.45 and just to refresh our memory this division operator returns a floating division operator returns a floating division operator returns a floating point number but if we use double point number but if we use double point number but if we use double slashes we'll get an integer slashes we'll get an integer slashes we'll get an integer in this case i want to get a floating in this case i want to get a floating in this case i want to get a floating point number point number point number so so so finally let's print finally let's print finally let's print a formatted string a formatted string a formatted string ur ur ur curly braces curly braces curly braces converted converted converted pounds pounds pounds okay okay okay now let's run this program and see what now let's run this program and see what now let's run this program and see what happens happens happens weight is 160 weight is 160 weight is 160 in pounds in pounds in pounds and that equals to 72 kilos perfect if and that equals to 72 kilos perfect if and that equals to 72 kilos perfect if we run it one more time we run it one more time we run it one more time and enter 72 and enter 72 and enter 72 kilos kilos kilos we get 160 pounds in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to use while loops in python we use how to use while loops in python we use how to use while loops in python we use while loops to execute a block of code while loops to execute a block of code while loops to execute a block of code multiple times and they're often useful multiple times and they're often useful multiple times and they're often useful in building interactive programs and in building interactive programs and in building interactive programs and games in a future tutorial i'm going to games in a future tutorial i'm going to games in a future tutorial i'm going to show you how to build a simple game show you how to build a simple game show you how to build a simple game using a while loop using a while loop using a while loop so let's get started with the basics so let's get started with the basics so let's get started with the basics we write a wild statement and right we write a wild statement and right we write a wild statement and right after that we type a condition followed after that we type a condition followed after that we type a condition followed by a colon by a colon by a colon as long as this condition is true the as long as this condition is true the as long as this condition is true the code that we write in this block will be code that we write in this block will be code that we write in this block will be repetitively executed here is an example repetitively executed here is an example repetitively executed here is an example we can define a variable we can define a variable we can define a variable like i as in short for index and set it like i as in short for index and set it like i as in short for index and set it to 1. to 1. to 1. now we set our condition to i less than now we set our condition to i less than now we set our condition to i less than or equal to 5. so as long as i is less or equal to 5. so as long as i is less or equal to 5. so as long as i is less than or equal to 5 we can print i than or equal to 5 we can print i than or equal to 5 we can print i on the terminal and then we need to on the terminal and then we need to on the terminal and then we need to increment i by one so we set i to i plus increment i by one so we set i to i plus increment i by one so we set i to i plus one the reason we do this is that if we one the reason we do this is that if we one the reason we do this is that if we don't do this i will be one forever so don't do this i will be one forever so don't do this i will be one forever so we'll end up with an infinite loop we'll end up with an infinite loop we'll end up with an infinite loop because this condition will always be because this condition will always be because this condition will always be true 1 is always less than 5. so in true 1 is always less than 5. so in true 1 is always less than 5. so in every iteration of this loop we every iteration of this loop we every iteration of this loop we increment i by 1 so at some point i is increment i by 1 so at some point i is increment i by 1 so at some point i is going to be 6 and then that is when this going to be 6 and then that is when this going to be 6 and then that is when this condition will be false and then we'll condition will be false and then we'll condition will be false and then we'll jump out of this loop okay jump out of this loop okay jump out of this loop okay now to demonstrate how everything works now to demonstrate how everything works now to demonstrate how everything works after this loop i'm going to add a print after this loop i'm going to add a print after this loop i'm going to add a print statement statement statement say done so note that these two lines say done so note that these two lines say done so note that these two lines are indented so they are part of the are indented so they are part of the are indented so they are part of the while block while block while block okay now let's go ahead and run this okay now let's go ahead and run this okay now let's go ahead and run this program to see what happens program to see what happens program to see what happens so so so take a look we get the numbers 1 to 5 take a look we get the numbers 1 to 5 take a look we get the numbers 1 to 5 followed by followed by followed by done done done so here's how this program gets executed so here's how this program gets executed so here's how this program gets executed first we set i to one now python first we set i to one now python first we set i to one now python interpreter executes line two this interpreter executes line two this interpreter executes line two this condition is true because i is less than condition is true because i is less than condition is true because i is less than five so five so five so i is printed on the terminal and then i is printed on the terminal and then i is printed on the terminal and then incremented by one incremented by one incremented by one then the control moves back to the then the control moves back to the then the control moves back to the beginning of the while loop so it beginning of the while loop so it beginning of the while loop so it doesn't go to the next statement doesn't go to the next statement doesn't go to the next statement so we come back here now we are in the so we come back here now we are in the so we come back here now we are in the second iteration in the second iteration second iteration in the second iteration second iteration in the second iteration i is 2 and because 2 is less than 5 our i is 2 and because 2 is less than 5 our i is 2 and because 2 is less than 5 our condition is still true so i will be condition is still true so i will be condition is still true so i will be printed on a terminal and once again it printed on a terminal and once again it printed on a terminal and once again it will be incremented by 1. so at some will be incremented by 1. so at some will be incremented by 1. so at some point i is going to be 6 and that's when point i is going to be 6 and that's when point i is going to be 6 and that's when this condition will be false so our loop this condition will be false so our loop this condition will be false so our loop will be terminated and then this dom will be terminated and then this dom will be terminated and then this dom message will be printed on the terminal message will be printed on the terminal message will be printed on the terminal so this is the basics of while loops now so this is the basics of while loops now so this is the basics of while loops now let's make this program a little bit let's make this program a little bit let's make this program a little bit more interesting more interesting more interesting here we can write an expression like here we can write an expression like here we can write an expression like this this this we add a string we add a string we add a string and in this string we add an asterisk and in this string we add an asterisk and in this string we add an asterisk and then we multiply this string by i and then we multiply this string by i and then we multiply this string by i so with this expression we can repeat a so with this expression we can repeat a so with this expression we can repeat a string when we multiply a string by a string when we multiply a string by a string when we multiply a string by a number that string will be repeated for number that string will be repeated for number that string will be repeated for example if i is 2 example if i is 2 example if i is 2 this expression would produce this expression would produce this expression would produce a string with two asterisks a string with two asterisks a string with two asterisks okay now let's run the program and see okay now let's run the program and see okay now let's run the program and see what we get so we get this little what we get so we get this little what we get so we get this little triangle shape here because in the first triangle shape here because in the first triangle shape here because in the first iteration i is one so iteration i is one so iteration i is one so one times an asterisk produces one one times an asterisk produces one one times an asterisk produces one asterisk asterisk asterisk in the second iteration i is two so when in the second iteration i is two so when in the second iteration i is two so when we multiply two by one asterisk we'll we multiply two by one asterisk we'll we multiply two by one asterisk we'll get two asterisks in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to use a while loop to build a how to use a while loop to build a how to use a while loop to build a guessing game like this guessing game like this guessing game like this so we have this secret number which is so we have this secret number which is so we have this secret number which is currently set to nine now the computer currently set to nine now the computer currently set to nine now the computer is asking me to make a guess so let's is asking me to make a guess so let's is asking me to make a guess so let's say one say one say one it's not right because the secret number it's not right because the secret number it's not right because the secret number is nine i can try again two is nine i can try again two is nine i can try again two no it's not right let's try again so i no it's not right let's try again so i no it's not right let's try again so i only have three chances to make a guess only have three chances to make a guess only have three chances to make a guess if i can't guess the number the program if i can't guess the number the program if i can't guess the number the program tells me that i failed let's run the tells me that i failed let's run the tells me that i failed let's run the program one more time this time i'm program one more time this time i'm program one more time this time i'm gonna guess the number so it's nine gonna guess the number so it's nine gonna guess the number so it's nine there you go it says you win so let's go there you go it says you win so let's go there you go it says you win so let's go ahead and build this program using a ahead and build this program using a ahead and build this program using a while loop while loop while loop all right let's start by defining a all right let's start by defining a all right let's start by defining a variable to store our secret number so variable to store our secret number so variable to store our secret number so we call that secret underline number and we call that secret underline number and we call that secret underline number and set it to 9. set it to 9. set it to 9. now we need a while loop to repeatedly now we need a while loop to repeatedly now we need a while loop to repeatedly ask a user to make a guess ask a user to make a guess ask a user to make a guess so while so while so while condition cola condition cola condition cola what is our condition here what is our condition here what is our condition here well we want to give our user a maximum well we want to give our user a maximum well we want to give our user a maximum of three guesses so similar to the last of three guesses so similar to the last of three guesses so similar to the last tutorial we can define a variable like i tutorial we can define a variable like i tutorial we can define a variable like i set it to zero and assume this set it to zero and assume this set it to zero and assume this represents the number of guesses the represents the number of guesses the represents the number of guesses the user has made user has made user has made and then we can write our condition as i and then we can write our condition as i and then we can write our condition as i less than less than less than 3. 3. 3. note that here i'm not using less than note that here i'm not using less than note that here i'm not using less than or equal to operator because with this or equal to operator because with this or equal to operator because with this condition our loop will be executed four condition our loop will be executed four condition our loop will be executed four times while i is 0 1 2 and 3. times while i is 0 1 2 and 3. times while i is 0 1 2 and 3. so here we should use the less than so here we should use the less than so here we should use the less than operator now if we give this code to operator now if we give this code to operator now if we give this code to someone else it's not quite clear what someone else it's not quite clear what someone else it's not quite clear what does i represent here it's only in r does i represent here it's only in r does i represent here it's only in r head that i represents the number of head that i represents the number of head that i represents the number of guesses the user has made so as a best guesses the user has made so as a best guesses the user has made so as a best practice always use meaningful and practice always use meaningful and practice always use meaningful and descriptive names for your variables so descriptive names for your variables so descriptive names for your variables so it's better to rename this variable to it's better to rename this variable to it's better to rename this variable to guess count let me show you how to guess count let me show you how to guess count let me show you how to rename rename rename so right click on i variable so right click on i variable so right click on i variable and then go to refactor and then go to refactor and then go to refactor and rename look at the shortcut on a mac and rename look at the shortcut on a mac and rename look at the shortcut on a mac computer that's shift and f6 computer that's shift and f6 computer that's shift and f6 now in this dialog box we can easily now in this dialog box we can easily now in this dialog box we can easily rename a variable and pycharm will rename a variable and pycharm will rename a variable and pycharm will update all the references to that update all the references to that update all the references to that variable so we don't have to manually variable so we don't have to manually variable so we don't have to manually update each instance okay let's change update each instance okay let's change update each instance okay let's change this to this to this to yes underline count yes underline count yes underline count enter there you go now that is better enter there you go now that is better enter there you go now that is better also it's better to store three in a also it's better to store three in a also it's better to store three in a separate variable to make our code more separate variable to make our code more separate variable to make our code more readable because it's not quite clear readable because it's not quite clear readable because it's not quite clear what does three represent here so what does three represent here so what does three represent here so let's define a variable called guess let's define a variable called guess let's define a variable called guess limit and set it to three limit and set it to three limit and set it to three and then we can change three to guess and then we can change three to guess and then we can change three to guess underline limit now our code is more underline limit now our code is more underline limit now our code is more readable while guess count is less than readable while guess count is less than readable while guess count is less than guess limit see it reads like a story guess limit see it reads like a story guess limit see it reads like a story this is how you should write code this is how you should write code this is how you should write code all right all right all right so while this condition is true you want so while this condition is true you want so while this condition is true you want to ask the user to make a guess so here to ask the user to make a guess so here to ask the user to make a guess so here we use our input function we use our input function we use our input function guess guess guess now whatever the user enters comes out now whatever the user enters comes out now whatever the user enters comes out as a string so we need to convert it to as a string so we need to convert it to as a string so we need to convert it to an integer so right here we pass the an integer so right here we pass the an integer so right here we pass the result to the end function result to the end function result to the end function and then get it and store it in a and then get it and store it in a and then get it and store it in a separate variable called guess separate variable called guess separate variable called guess so at this point the user made a guess so at this point the user made a guess so at this point the user made a guess now we need to increment guess count so now we need to increment guess count so now we need to increment guess count so guess count guess count guess count we set it to plus equal one okay now we we set it to plus equal one okay now we we set it to plus equal one okay now we need to check to see if the user made need to check to see if the user made need to check to see if the user made the right guess so here we need an if the right guess so here we need an if the right guess so here we need an if statement statement statement if if if what the user guessed what the user guessed what the user guessed equals equals equals our secret number again see our code is our secret number again see our code is our secret number again see our code is so readable it's like a story you can so readable it's like a story you can so readable it's like a story you can read it like plain english read it like plain english read it like plain english so if this condition is true you want to so if this condition is true you want to so if this condition is true you want to tell the user they won so print tell the user they won so print tell the user they won so print you one you one you one now let's go ahead and run our program now let's go ahead and run our program now let's go ahead and run our program up to this point so up to this point so up to this point so okay it's asking me to make a guess i'm okay it's asking me to make a guess i'm okay it's asking me to make a guess i'm gonna make the wrong guess of one it gonna make the wrong guess of one it gonna make the wrong guess of one it asks me again beautiful two one more asks me again beautiful two one more asks me again beautiful two one more time three time three time three okay what is missing in this okay what is missing in this okay what is missing in this implementation is the message that tells implementation is the message that tells implementation is the message that tells me that i failed we're going to take me that i failed we're going to take me that i failed we're going to take care of it momentarily but let's run the care of it momentarily but let's run the care of it momentarily but let's run the program one more time and make the right program one more time and make the right program one more time and make the right guess so nine guess so nine guess so nine okay it says you won but it's still okay it says you won but it's still okay it says you won but it's still asking me to make a guess because our asking me to make a guess because our asking me to make a guess because our while loop is going to get executed while loop is going to get executed while loop is going to get executed three times look one and two three times look one and two three times look one and two so we need to change our program such so we need to change our program such so we need to change our program such that if the user makes the right guess that if the user makes the right guess that if the user makes the right guess we need to terminate our while loop we we need to terminate our while loop we we need to terminate our while loop we need to jump out of it need to jump out of it need to jump out of it how do we do that how do we do that how do we do that so over here if the user makes the right so over here if the user makes the right so over here if the user makes the right guess guess guess after we print this message we can use after we print this message we can use after we print this message we can use the break statement to terminate a loop the break statement to terminate a loop the break statement to terminate a loop when python interpreter sees this it's when python interpreter sees this it's when python interpreter sees this it's going to immediately terminate our loop going to immediately terminate our loop going to immediately terminate our loop it's not going to evaluate this it's not going to evaluate this it's not going to evaluate this condition again condition again condition again now let's run our program and see what now let's run our program and see what now let's run our program and see what happens happens happens so so so i'm going to guess the right number i'm going to guess the right number i'm going to guess the right number you want and look we were not asked to you want and look we were not asked to you want and look we were not asked to make two more guesses beautiful make two more guesses beautiful make two more guesses beautiful now the last thing that we need to add now the last thing that we need to add now the last thing that we need to add here is the message that tells the user here is the message that tells the user here is the message that tells the user that they failed if they couldn't guess that they failed if they couldn't guess that they failed if they couldn't guess the right number the right number the right number how do we do that well in python our how do we do that well in python our how do we do that well in python our while loops can optionally have an else while loops can optionally have an else while loops can optionally have an else part similar to the if statements so part similar to the if statements so part similar to the if statements so earlier you learned that our if earlier you learned that our if earlier you learned that our if statements can optionally have an else statements can optionally have an else statements can optionally have an else part part part like here like here like here so so so if this condition is true do this if this condition is true do this if this condition is true do this otherwise do something else right in otherwise do something else right in otherwise do something else right in this case our if statement doesn't have this case our if statement doesn't have this case our if statement doesn't have an else part an else part an else part now now now similar to the if statements our while similar to the if statements our while similar to the if statements our while loops our while statements can also have loops our while statements can also have loops our while statements can also have an else part an else part an else part so so so right at this level right at this level right at this level we can add an else block so else colon we can add an else block so else colon we can add an else block so else colon and the code that we write here will get and the code that we write here will get and the code that we write here will get executed if this while loop completes executed if this while loop completes executed if this while loop completes successfully without an immediate break successfully without an immediate break successfully without an immediate break in other words if the user guesses the in other words if the user guesses the in other words if the user guesses the right number we break this loop we jump right number we break this loop we jump right number we break this loop we jump out of it so the code that we write in out of it so the code that we write in out of it so the code that we write in the else block will not get executed but the else block will not get executed but the else block will not get executed but if the user cannot guess this number if the user cannot guess this number if the user cannot guess this number we're never going to break out of this we're never going to break out of this we're never going to break out of this loop so this load will be executed to loop so this load will be executed to loop so this load will be executed to completion until this condition becomes completion until this condition becomes completion until this condition becomes false in that case the code that we false in that case the code that we false in that case the code that we write in the else block will get write in the else block will get write in the else block will get executed and this is the perfect executed and this is the perfect executed and this is the perfect opportunity for us to tell the user hey opportunity for us to tell the user hey opportunity for us to tell the user hey you made three guesses but none of them you made three guesses but none of them you made three guesses but none of them were right so were right so were right so print sorry print sorry print sorry you failed you failed you failed now let's test our program one more time now let's test our program one more time now let's test our program one more time so guess one two three so guess one two three so guess one two three sorry you failed let's run it one more sorry you failed let's run it one more sorry you failed let's run it one more time this time i'm going to make a wrong time this time i'm going to make a wrong time this time i'm going to make a wrong guess guess guess and then the right guess and then the right guess and then the right guess we won and our loop terminated we won and our loop terminated we won and our loop terminated immediately all right now it's time for you to all right now it's time for you to all right now it's time for you to practice what you have learned so far so practice what you have learned so far so practice what you have learned so far so once again we're going to build a game once again we're going to build a game once again we're going to build a game this game is a simulation for a card this game is a simulation for a card this game is a simulation for a card game now our game doesn't have a game now our game doesn't have a game now our game doesn't have a graphical user interface or gui and it graphical user interface or gui and it graphical user interface or gui and it doesn't really matter for now our focus doesn't really matter for now our focus doesn't really matter for now our focus is entirely on building the engine for is entirely on building the engine for is entirely on building the engine for this game this game this game so let's see how this program works when so let's see how this program works when so let's see how this program works when we run this we get this little symbol we run this we get this little symbol we run this we get this little symbol here here here and our program is waiting for us to and our program is waiting for us to and our program is waiting for us to enter a command enter a command enter a command if we type help either in lowercase or if we type help either in lowercase or if we type help either in lowercase or uppercase it doesn't matter we get the uppercase it doesn't matter we get the uppercase it doesn't matter we get the list of commands that our program or our list of commands that our program or our list of commands that our program or our game currently supports so we can type game currently supports so we can type game currently supports so we can type the start command to start our car we the start command to start our car we the start command to start our car we can type the stop command to stop our can type the stop command to stop our can type the stop command to stop our car and quit to terminate the game any car and quit to terminate the game any car and quit to terminate the game any other commands that we type our program other commands that we type our program other commands that we type our program is going to tell us hey i don't is going to tell us hey i don't is going to tell us hey i don't understand that for example if i type understand that for example if i type understand that for example if i type asd here asd here asd here it says i don't understand that if we it says i don't understand that if we it says i don't understand that if we type start type start type start we get this message car started ready to we get this message car started ready to we get this message car started ready to go if you type stop go if you type stop go if you type stop it says car stopped and finally if we it says car stopped and finally if we it says car stopped and finally if we type quit type quit type quit our program terminates this is a our program terminates this is a our program terminates this is a fantastic exercise for you to practice fantastic exercise for you to practice fantastic exercise for you to practice what you have learned so pause the video what you have learned so pause the video what you have learned so pause the video and spend five to ten minutes to build and spend five to ten minutes to build and spend five to ten minutes to build this program all right we're going to start with a all right we're going to start with a all right we're going to start with a while loop while loop while loop with a condition with a condition with a condition what is our condition here what is our condition here what is our condition here we want to run this loop until the user we want to run this loop until the user we want to run this loop until the user types quit so we can define a variable types quit so we can define a variable types quit so we can define a variable for storing the command that the user for storing the command that the user for storing the command that the user enters and then we can run this loop as enters and then we can run this loop as enters and then we can run this loop as long as the command does not equal to long as the command does not equal to long as the command does not equal to quit quit quit so right before the loop we define a so right before the loop we define a so right before the loop we define a variable command and initially we set it variable command and initially we set it variable command and initially we set it to an empty string an empty string is a to an empty string an empty string is a to an empty string an empty string is a string that has no characters in it we string that has no characters in it we string that has no characters in it we only have the quotes okay only have the quotes okay only have the quotes okay so so so then we type out our condition as then we type out our condition as then we type out our condition as while command does not equal to while command does not equal to while command does not equal to quit then quit then quit then do something do something do something now immediately we have a problem here now immediately we have a problem here now immediately we have a problem here because we're assuming that the user because we're assuming that the user because we're assuming that the user types the command in lower case so if types the command in lower case so if types the command in lower case so if they type this in uppercase our program they type this in uppercase our program they type this in uppercase our program is not going to behave properly so to is not going to behave properly so to is not going to behave properly so to fix this problem we need to call the fix this problem we need to call the fix this problem we need to call the lower method of the string object and lower method of the string object and lower method of the string object and then compare the result then compare the result then compare the result with this quit we could also call upper with this quit we could also call upper with this quit we could also call upper and then type quit in uppercase it's a and then type quit in uppercase it's a and then type quit in uppercase it's a matter of personal preference in this matter of personal preference in this matter of personal preference in this demo i'm going to use lowercase demo i'm going to use lowercase demo i'm going to use lowercase characters so okay characters so okay characters so okay now in this loop we need to ask the user now in this loop we need to ask the user now in this loop we need to ask the user to enter a command so once again we're to enter a command so once again we're to enter a command so once again we're going to use our input function going to use our input function going to use our input function we add a greater than symbol we add a greater than symbol we add a greater than symbol followed by a space whatever the user followed by a space whatever the user followed by a space whatever the user enters we get it and store it in our enters we get it and store it in our enters we get it and store it in our command variable command variable command variable now apart from the quit command there now apart from the quit command there now apart from the quit command there are three other commands that we need to are three other commands that we need to are three other commands that we need to support start stop and help so here we support start stop and help so here we support start stop and help so here we need an if statement to compare what the need an if statement to compare what the need an if statement to compare what the user enters with one of the supported user enters with one of the supported user enters with one of the supported commands commands commands so so so if command if command if command that lower that lower that lower equals start equals start equals start then you want to print a message like then you want to print a message like then you want to print a message like the car started so print the car started so print the car started so print car started car started car started ready to go it doesn't matter ready to go it doesn't matter ready to go it doesn't matter now the second condition what if it's now the second condition what if it's now the second condition what if it's not start maybe it's stop so not start maybe it's stop so not start maybe it's stop so alif command that lower alif command that lower alif command that lower equals equals equals stop there you go then we print a stop there you go then we print a stop there you go then we print a different message car stopped different message car stopped different message car stopped now look at our code we have repeated now look at our code we have repeated now look at our code we have repeated this lower lower lower multiple times this lower lower lower multiple times this lower lower lower multiple times this is bad in programming we have a this is bad in programming we have a this is bad in programming we have a term called dry which is short for don't term called dry which is short for don't term called dry which is short for don't repeat yourself repeat yourself repeat yourself so whenever you have duplicating your so whenever you have duplicating your so whenever you have duplicating your code that means you are doing something code that means you are doing something code that means you are doing something wrong so how can we solve this problem wrong so how can we solve this problem wrong so how can we solve this problem well instead of calling the lower method well instead of calling the lower method well instead of calling the lower method in each condition we can call it right in each condition we can call it right in each condition we can call it right here when we get the input from the user here when we get the input from the user here when we get the input from the user so this input function as you know so this input function as you know so this input function as you know returns a string we can immediately call returns a string we can immediately call returns a string we can immediately call the lower method on that string and with the lower method on that string and with the lower method on that string and with this our command will always be in lower this our command will always be in lower this our command will always be in lower case so we don't need to case so we don't need to case so we don't need to call this method in every condition call this method in every condition call this method in every condition look look look we remove the duplication and also our we remove the duplication and also our we remove the duplication and also our conditions are shorter and easier to conditions are shorter and easier to conditions are shorter and easier to read there's also one more place we need read there's also one more place we need read there's also one more place we need to modify so it's right here to modify so it's right here to modify so it's right here that is better that is better that is better now the third command we need one more now the third command we need one more now the third command we need one more alif alif alif if the command equals help if the command equals help if the command equals help then then then we want to show the commands that we we want to show the commands that we we want to show the commands that we support so here we're going to print a support so here we're going to print a support so here we're going to print a multi-line string multi-line string multi-line string so we use triple quotes so we use triple quotes so we use triple quotes like this like this like this and give the user a guideline like this and give the user a guideline like this and give the user a guideline like this so start so start so start to start the car to start the car to start the car stop stop stop to stop the car and quit and quit and quit to quit to quit to quit now finally we need an else part so if now finally we need an else part so if now finally we need an else part so if what the user enters is none of these what the user enters is none of these what the user enters is none of these commands we're going to tell them hey we commands we're going to tell them hey we commands we're going to tell them hey we don't understand this don't understand this don't understand this so so so else colon else colon else colon print print print sorry i don't understand that sorry i don't understand that sorry i don't understand that and by the way and by the way and by the way note that here because i'm using double note that here because i'm using double note that here because i'm using double quotes i can easily use a single quote quotes i can easily use a single quote quotes i can easily use a single quote as an apostrophe okay as an apostrophe okay as an apostrophe okay so so so let's run our program up to this point let's run our program up to this point let's run our program up to this point and see what happens and see what happens and see what happens all right let's type start car started all right let's type start car started all right let's type start car started beautiful stop beautiful stop beautiful stop car stopped car stopped car stopped help help help we get this guideline but there's so we get this guideline but there's so we get this guideline but there's so much indentation before our commands much indentation before our commands much indentation before our commands we'll fix that in a second and finally we'll fix that in a second and finally we'll fix that in a second and finally let's test the quit command let's test the quit command let's test the quit command oops our program didn't work properly oops our program didn't work properly oops our program didn't work properly here's the reason with this if statement here's the reason with this if statement here's the reason with this if statement we're comparing the command with start we're comparing the command with start we're comparing the command with start stop and help anything else will end up stop and help anything else will end up stop and help anything else will end up here so that's why our program says it here so that's why our program says it here so that's why our program says it doesn't understand that doesn't understand that doesn't understand that so that's why our program says it so that's why our program says it so that's why our program says it doesn't understand that command however doesn't understand that command however doesn't understand that command however after this else statement the control after this else statement the control after this else statement the control will be moved to the beginning of the will be moved to the beginning of the will be moved to the beginning of the loop at this point our command is quit loop at this point our command is quit loop at this point our command is quit so our loop will complete and the so our loop will complete and the so our loop will complete and the program terminates in other words when program terminates in other words when program terminates in other words when we run this program we run this program we run this program and type quit and type quit and type quit our program actually quits but we still our program actually quits but we still our program actually quits but we still see this message which shouldn't appear see this message which shouldn't appear see this message which shouldn't appear here how can we solve this problem well here how can we solve this problem well here how can we solve this problem well we can come back here we can come back here we can come back here and just before the else block add and just before the else block add and just before the else block add another alif another alif another alif something like this alif command something like this alif command something like this alif command equals equals equals quit quit quit then we can immediately break then we can immediately break then we can immediately break this will solve our problem but note this will solve our problem but note this will solve our problem but note that we have kind of repeated this that we have kind of repeated this that we have kind of repeated this expression in two places expression in two places expression in two places the reality is we don't really need this the reality is we don't really need this the reality is we don't really need this condition on the top because with this condition on the top because with this condition on the top because with this if statements well more accurately with if statements well more accurately with if statements well more accurately with this alif we can jump out of this loop this alif we can jump out of this loop this alif we can jump out of this loop and terminate our program so we can and terminate our program so we can and terminate our program so we can simplify our condition simplify our condition simplify our condition to something like this true to something like this true to something like this true so while true means this block of code so while true means this block of code so while true means this block of code is going to get executed repeatedly is going to get executed repeatedly is going to get executed repeatedly until we explicitly break out of it okay until we explicitly break out of it okay until we explicitly break out of it okay now let's test our program one more time now let's test our program one more time now let's test our program one more time so so so quit quit quit now our program terminates and we don't now our program terminates and we don't now our program terminates and we don't see that message beautiful see that message beautiful see that message beautiful so let's fix the last problem you saw so let's fix the last problem you saw so let's fix the last problem you saw that when we typed help that when we typed help that when we typed help these guidelines appeared with so much these guidelines appeared with so much these guidelines appeared with so much indentation and here's the reason look indentation and here's the reason look indentation and here's the reason look right here in our code they're already right here in our code they're already right here in our code they're already indented so when we use triple quotes indented so when we use triple quotes indented so when we use triple quotes what we type here will be printed what we type here will be printed what we type here will be printed exactly as is exactly as is exactly as is so because we have indentation here this so because we have indentation here this so because we have indentation here this indentation will also be printed on the indentation will also be printed on the indentation will also be printed on the terminal so let's delete terminal so let's delete terminal so let's delete these these these okay run the program one more time okay run the program one more time okay run the program one more time type help type help type help the annotation is gone beautiful now the annotation is gone beautiful now the annotation is gone beautiful now here's a challenge for you i want you to here's a challenge for you i want you to here's a challenge for you i want you to take this program to the next level so take this program to the next level so take this program to the next level so right now if we type start we get this right now if we type start we get this right now if we type start we get this message car started and if we type start message car started and if we type start message car started and if we type start again again again we get the same message it would be we get the same message it would be we get the same message it would be better if we got a message like car is better if we got a message like car is better if we got a message like car is already started so it doesn't make sense already started so it doesn't make sense already started so it doesn't make sense to store the car twice similarly to store the car twice similarly to store the car twice similarly if we type stop if we type stop if we type stop it says car stopped if we type it again it says car stopped if we type it again it says car stopped if we type it again we get the exact same message it doesn't we get the exact same message it doesn't we get the exact same message it doesn't make sense to stop a car twice so here's make sense to stop a car twice so here's make sense to stop a car twice so here's what i need you to do if the car is what i need you to do if the car is what i need you to do if the car is stopped and the user tries to stop it stopped and the user tries to stop it stopped and the user tries to stop it again the program should say hey the car again the program should say hey the car again the program should say hey the car is already stopped what are you doing is already stopped what are you doing is already stopped what are you doing and similarly if the car is already and similarly if the car is already and similarly if the car is already started and the user tries to start it started and the user tries to start it started and the user tries to start it again the program should yell at the again the program should yell at the again the program should yell at the user so go ahead and make the necessary user so go ahead and make the necessary user so go ahead and make the necessary changes to implement this scenario all right to add this to our program we all right to add this to our program we all right to add this to our program we need to know if the car is started or need to know if the car is started or need to know if the car is started or not so there is one more piece of not so there is one more piece of not so there is one more piece of information that we need to store in the information that we need to store in the information that we need to store in the memory what is the kind of data we need memory what is the kind of data we need memory what is the kind of data we need to store here a boolean is the car to store here a boolean is the car to store here a boolean is the car started or not it's a matter of yes or started or not it's a matter of yes or started or not it's a matter of yes or no true or false so on the top no true or false so on the top no true or false so on the top here we can define another variable like here we can define another variable like here we can define another variable like started and initially we set it to false started and initially we set it to false started and initially we set it to false so the car is not started right so the car is not started right so the car is not started right now now now when the user types the start command when the user types the start command when the user types the start command here we need to check to see if the car here we need to check to see if the car here we need to check to see if the car is already started if not we'll start it is already started if not we'll start it is already started if not we'll start it otherwise we'll yell at the user so in otherwise we'll yell at the user so in otherwise we'll yell at the user so in this block we write another if statement this block we write another if statement this block we write another if statement if it's already started if it's already started if it's already started then we print then we print then we print car is already started car is already started car is already started otherwise so we add an else statement otherwise so we add an else statement otherwise so we add an else statement here here here and at this point we set started to true and at this point we set started to true and at this point we set started to true so we start the car and print this so we start the car and print this so we start the car and print this message okay message okay message okay now we need to make a similar change now we need to make a similar change now we need to make a similar change for the stop command so if the car is for the stop command so if the car is for the stop command so if the car is already stopped already stopped already stopped we need to print a different message we need to print a different message we need to print a different message if if if not started so here we're using the not not started so here we're using the not not started so here we're using the not operator to see if the car is stopped operator to see if the car is stopped operator to see if the car is stopped so if it's not started that means it's so if it's not started that means it's so if it's not started that means it's stopped okay stopped okay stopped okay so if it stopped your print so if it stopped your print so if it stopped your print car is already stopped car is already stopped car is already stopped with double p's with double p's with double p's otherwise so else otherwise so else otherwise so else we need to stop the car how do we do we need to stop the car how do we do we need to stop the car how do we do that we set started to false and then that we set started to false and then that we set started to false and then we'll print this message we'll print this message we'll print this message as easy as that let's go ahead and run as easy as that let's go ahead and run as easy as that let's go ahead and run our program our program our program so so so initially our car is stopped so i'm initially our car is stopped so i'm initially our car is stopped so i'm going to type stop going to type stop going to type stop it says the car is already stopped so it says the car is already stopped so it says the car is already stopped so let's start it let's start it let's start it okay now our car is started let's start okay now our car is started let's start okay now our car is started let's start it one more time it one more time it one more time the program is yelling at us so we the program is yelling at us so we the program is yelling at us so we cannot start a car twice beautiful now cannot start a car twice beautiful now cannot start a car twice beautiful now let's stop it let's stop it let's stop it it says the car is stopped let's stop it it says the car is stopped let's stop it it says the car is stopped let's stop it one more time we get this message again in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about for loops in python in you guys about for loops in python in you guys about for loops in python in the last tutorial you learned about the last tutorial you learned about the last tutorial you learned about while loops you'll learn that we use while loops you'll learn that we use while loops you'll learn that we use while loops to execute a block of code while loops to execute a block of code while loops to execute a block of code multiple times in python we have another multiple times in python we have another multiple times in python we have another kind of loop that is a for loop and we kind of loop that is a for loop and we kind of loop that is a for loop and we use that to iterate over items of a use that to iterate over items of a use that to iterate over items of a collection such as a string because a collection such as a string because a collection such as a string because a string is a sequence of characters so it string is a sequence of characters so it string is a sequence of characters so it looks like a collection so we can use a looks like a collection so we can use a looks like a collection so we can use a for loop to iterate over each character for loop to iterate over each character for loop to iterate over each character in a string and then do something with in a string and then do something with in a string and then do something with it here's an example we type out four it here's an example we type out four it here's an example we type out four then we define a variable this is what then we define a variable this is what then we define a variable this is what we call a loop variable in each we call a loop variable in each we call a loop variable in each iteration this variable will hold one iteration this variable will hold one iteration this variable will hold one item item item so let's call it item so let's call it item so let's call it item in here we type out a string like python in here we type out a string like python in here we type out a string like python and then colon and then colon and then colon so with this for loop we can iterate so with this for loop we can iterate so with this for loop we can iterate over this string and in each iteration over this string and in each iteration over this string and in each iteration this item variable will hold one this item variable will hold one this item variable will hold one character at a time in the first character at a time in the first character at a time in the first iteration it will be set to p then in iteration it will be set to p then in iteration it will be set to p then in the second iteration it will be set to y the second iteration it will be set to y the second iteration it will be set to y in the third iteration it will be set to in the third iteration it will be set to in the third iteration it will be set to t and so on okay t and so on okay t and so on okay so here we are inside our four block so here we are inside our four block so here we are inside our four block because of the indentation here so because of the indentation here so because of the indentation here so whatever we type here will be executed whatever we type here will be executed whatever we type here will be executed in each iteration for now we can simply in each iteration for now we can simply in each iteration for now we can simply print this item print this item print this item now let's run this program and see what now let's run this program and see what now let's run this program and see what happens happens happens so you can see each character in our so you can see each character in our so you can see each character in our string is printed on a new line string is printed on a new line string is printed on a new line let's look at another example let's look at another example let's look at another example in python we can define lists using in python we can define lists using in python we can define lists using square brackets so let me remove this square brackets so let me remove this square brackets so let me remove this string from here string from here string from here and define a list using square brackets and define a list using square brackets and define a list using square brackets a list is simply a list of items like a a list is simply a list of items like a a list is simply a list of items like a list of numbers a list of customers a list of numbers a list of customers a list of numbers a list of customers a list of emails products blog posts list of emails products blog posts list of emails products blog posts whatever so here we can define a list of whatever so here we can define a list of whatever so here we can define a list of names like mosh names like mosh names like mosh john john john sarah sarah sarah and then go ahead run our program so you and then go ahead run our program so you and then go ahead run our program so you can see in each iteration we get one can see in each iteration we get one can see in each iteration we get one name name name and print it on a new line and print it on a new line and print it on a new line we can also loop over a list of numbers we can also loop over a list of numbers we can also loop over a list of numbers for example for example for example [Music] [Music] [Music] one two three four let's run it one two three four let's run it one two three four let's run it again we see each number on a new line again we see each number on a new line again we see each number on a new line but what if we want to iterate over a but what if we want to iterate over a but what if we want to iterate over a large list of numbers we don't want to large list of numbers we don't want to large list of numbers we don't want to explicitly type out a list with let's explicitly type out a list with let's explicitly type out a list with let's say a hundred or a thousand numbers but say a hundred or a thousand numbers but say a hundred or a thousand numbers but i want to type 567 all the way to 100 i want to type 567 all the way to 100 i want to type 567 all the way to 100 that is when we use the range function that is when we use the range function that is when we use the range function so let me delete this in python we have a built-in function in python we have a built-in function in python we have a built-in function called range for creating a range of called range for creating a range of called range for creating a range of numbers so numbers so numbers so we give it a number let's say 10. let's we give it a number let's say 10. let's we give it a number let's say 10. let's run this program run this program run this program now we can see here on the terminal we now we can see here on the terminal we now we can see here on the terminal we have numbers 0 have numbers 0 have numbers 0 all the way all the way all the way to 9. so 10 is not included so basically to 9. so 10 is not included so basically to 9. so 10 is not included so basically when we call the range function this when we call the range function this when we call the range function this range function creates an object it's range function creates an object it's range function creates an object it's not a list it's a special kind of object not a list it's a special kind of object not a list it's a special kind of object that we can iterate over in each that we can iterate over in each that we can iterate over in each iteration this object will spit out a iteration this object will spit out a iteration this object will spit out a new number we can also work with a range new number we can also work with a range new number we can also work with a range of numbers here let's say we want to of numbers here let's say we want to of numbers here let's say we want to start from 5 start from 5 start from 5 and go all the way to 10. and go all the way to 10. and go all the way to 10. so so so let's run our program let's run our program let's run our program now we have the numbers 5 6 7 and 9. now we have the numbers 5 6 7 and 9. now we have the numbers 5 6 7 and 9. also this range function can optionally also this range function can optionally also this range function can optionally take a step so we can pass take a step so we can pass take a step so we can pass to to to as the step to this function as the step to this function as the step to this function and when we run our program and when we run our program and when we run our program you can see that our first number is you can see that our first number is you can see that our first number is five now we go two steps forward to get five now we go two steps forward to get five now we go two steps forward to get seven once again we go two steps forward seven once again we go two steps forward seven once again we go two steps forward we get nine and that is the end of our we get nine and that is the end of our we get nine and that is the end of our range so this is the basics of using for range so this is the basics of using for range so this is the basics of using for loops in python loops in python loops in python now here's an exercise for you i want now here's an exercise for you i want now here's an exercise for you i want you to write a program to calculate the you to write a program to calculate the you to write a program to calculate the total cost of all the items in a total cost of all the items in a total cost of all the items in a shopping cart so let's say we have a shopping cart so let's say we have a shopping cart so let's say we have a list of prices list of prices list of prices like 10 like 10 like 10 20 and 30. 20 and 30. 20 and 30. i wanted to use a for loop to calculate i wanted to use a for loop to calculate i wanted to use a for loop to calculate the total cost of all the items in our the total cost of all the items in our the total cost of all the items in our imaginary shopping cart so calculate imaginary shopping cart so calculate imaginary shopping cart so calculate that and then print it on a terminal that and then print it on a terminal that and then print it on a terminal that's pretty easy and you should do it that's pretty easy and you should do it that's pretty easy and you should do it in a couple of minutes so as you learned we use for loops to so as you learned we use for loops to so as you learned we use for loops to iterate over all the items in a iterate over all the items in a iterate over all the items in a collection a collection can be a string collection a collection can be a string collection a collection can be a string it can be a list it can be a range it can be a list it can be a range it can be a list it can be a range object that is returned from the range object that is returned from the range object that is returned from the range function anything any kind of object function anything any kind of object function anything any kind of object that has multiple items that has multiple items that has multiple items so in this example we're going to use a so in this example we're going to use a so in this example we're going to use a for loop to iterate over the list of for loop to iterate over the list of for loop to iterate over the list of prices so for item in prices so for item in prices so for item in prices colon and by the way this loop prices colon and by the way this loop prices colon and by the way this loop variable we don't have to call this item variable we don't have to call this item variable we don't have to call this item we can call it anything for example in we can call it anything for example in we can call it anything for example in this case we can rename it to price so this case we can rename it to price so this case we can rename it to price so for price for price for price in prices in prices in prices now in each iteration this price will now in each iteration this price will now in each iteration this price will hold one value in the first iteration hold one value in the first iteration hold one value in the first iteration it's going to hold 10 then it's going to it's going to hold 10 then it's going to it's going to hold 10 then it's going to be 20 and then it's going to be 30. be 20 and then it's going to be 30. be 20 and then it's going to be 30. so we need to define another variable to so we need to define another variable to so we need to define another variable to calculate the total calculate the total calculate the total so so so we define that outside of a for loop we define that outside of a for loop we define that outside of a for loop let's call it total and initially we set let's call it total and initially we set let's call it total and initially we set it to zero it to zero it to zero now in each iteration we get the current now in each iteration we get the current now in each iteration we get the current price and add it to the total so price and add it to the total so price and add it to the total so rate total equals total plus price or as rate total equals total plus price or as rate total equals total plus price or as you learned earlier we can use the you learned earlier we can use the you learned earlier we can use the augmented assignment operator to augmented assignment operator to augmented assignment operator to simplify this code simplify this code simplify this code so so so after our for loop this total variable after our for loop this total variable after our for loop this total variable has the total of all the prices we can has the total of all the prices we can has the total of all the prices we can simply print it here simply print it here simply print it here or we can use a formatted string so or we can use a formatted string so or we can use a formatted string so a string prefix with f a string prefix with f a string prefix with f we add a label like total curly braces we add a label like total curly braces we add a label like total curly braces to dynamically include some value in our to dynamically include some value in our to dynamically include some value in our string in this case our total string in this case our total string in this case our total variable variable variable so let's go ahead and run this program so let's go ahead and run this program so let's go ahead and run this program there you go so the total cost of all there you go so the total cost of all there you go so the total cost of all the items in our imaginary shopping cart the items in our imaginary shopping cart the items in our imaginary shopping cart is 60. in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about nested loops in python you guys about nested loops in python you guys about nested loops in python using a nested loop basically means using a nested loop basically means using a nested loop basically means adding one loop inside of another loop adding one loop inside of another loop adding one loop inside of another loop and with this technique we can do some and with this technique we can do some and with this technique we can do some amazing things for example we can easily amazing things for example we can easily amazing things for example we can easily generate a list of coordinates so a generate a list of coordinates so a generate a list of coordinates so a coordinate as you know is a combination coordinate as you know is a combination coordinate as you know is a combination of an x and y value let's say 0 and 0. of an x and y value let's say 0 and 0. of an x and y value let's say 0 and 0. now let's say we want to generate a list now let's say we want to generate a list now let's say we want to generate a list of coordinates like this so we have 0 of coordinates like this so we have 0 of coordinates like this so we have 0 and 0 then we'll have 0 and 1 then 0 and and 0 then we'll have 0 and 1 then 0 and and 0 then we'll have 0 and 1 then 0 and next next next we're going to change x so we're going we're going to change x so we're going we're going to change x so we're going to use 1 for the x and once again we're to use 1 for the x and once again we're to use 1 for the x and once again we're going to use these three values for the going to use these three values for the going to use these three values for the y coordinates so 1 and 0 then y coordinates so 1 and 0 then y coordinates so 1 and 0 then 1 and 1 and 1 and 2. 1 and 1 and 1 and 2. 1 and 1 and 1 and 2. you got the point we can easily generate you got the point we can easily generate you got the point we can easily generate these coordinates using nested loops let these coordinates using nested loops let these coordinates using nested loops let me show you so we'll start with one loop me show you so we'll start with one loop me show you so we'll start with one loop let's say for x in range four let's say for x in range four let's say for x in range four with this loop we can generate values with this loop we can generate values with this loop we can generate values for the x coordinate let's print this on for the x coordinate let's print this on for the x coordinate let's print this on the terminal the terminal the terminal okay okay okay so we get the values 0 to 3. so we get the values 0 to 3. so we get the values 0 to 3. now for each x like 0 we should generate now for each x like 0 we should generate now for each x like 0 we should generate a few y values a few y values a few y values so that is where we use a nested loop so so that is where we use a nested loop so so that is where we use a nested loop so inside of this loop we're going to add inside of this loop we're going to add inside of this loop we're going to add another loop so instead of just printing another loop so instead of just printing another loop so instead of just printing x first we want to add x first we want to add x first we want to add another loop another loop another loop for y in range let's say 3 for y in range let's say 3 for y in range let's say 3 now we can print x and y together now we can print x and y together now we can print x and y together so print here we use a formatted string so print here we use a formatted string so print here we use a formatted string to display coordinates like this so we to display coordinates like this so we to display coordinates like this so we add parenthesis add parenthesis add parenthesis inside of this parenthesis first we need inside of this parenthesis first we need inside of this parenthesis first we need to add x so curly braces x to add x so curly braces x to add x so curly braces x then a comma then a comma then a comma followed by followed by followed by another set of curly braces and another set of curly braces and another set of curly braces and y y y let's run this program and see what we let's run this program and see what we let's run this program and see what we get there you go so we have these there you go so we have these there you go so we have these coordinates 0 and 0 0 and 1 0 and 2. coordinates 0 and 0 0 and 1 0 and 2. coordinates 0 and 0 0 and 1 0 and 2. then we have 1 and 0 1 and 1 1 and 2 and then we have 1 and 0 1 and 1 1 and 2 and then we have 1 and 0 1 and 1 1 and 2 and so on so let me explain exactly how this so on so let me explain exactly how this so on so let me explain exactly how this program gets executed program gets executed program gets executed so in the first iteration of our outer so in the first iteration of our outer so in the first iteration of our outer loop x is zero right loop x is zero right loop x is zero right now we are on line two here we have a now we are on line two here we have a now we are on line two here we have a new loop which we call an inner loop in new loop which we call an inner loop in new loop which we call an inner loop in this inner loop in the first iteration y this inner loop in the first iteration y this inner loop in the first iteration y is going to be zero is going to be zero is going to be zero so we print 0 and 0 on the terminal now so we print 0 and 0 on the terminal now so we print 0 and 0 on the terminal now the control goes back to line 2 or our the control goes back to line 2 or our the control goes back to line 2 or our inner loop in this second iteration y inner loop in this second iteration y inner loop in this second iteration y will be set to 1 but we're still in the will be set to 1 but we're still in the will be set to 1 but we're still in the first iteration first iteration first iteration of our outer loop so x is still 0 but of our outer loop so x is still 0 but of our outer loop so x is still 0 but now y is incremented to one now y is incremented to one now y is incremented to one so that is why we see zero and one on so that is why we see zero and one on so that is why we see zero and one on the terminal once again the control goes the terminal once again the control goes the terminal once again the control goes back to line two we are in the third back to line two we are in the third back to line two we are in the third iteration of our inner loop so this will iteration of our inner loop so this will iteration of our inner loop so this will continue until this inner loop completes continue until this inner loop completes continue until this inner loop completes that is when y reaches two because this that is when y reaches two because this that is when y reaches two because this range function generates number zero to range function generates number zero to range function generates number zero to three but not including three so we'll three but not including three so we'll three but not including three so we'll have zero one and two have zero one and two have zero one and two after this inner loop completes then the after this inner loop completes then the after this inner loop completes then the control goes back to line one at this control goes back to line one at this control goes back to line one at this point we're going to be in the second point we're going to be in the second point we're going to be in the second iteration of our outer loop so x will be iteration of our outer loop so x will be iteration of our outer loop so x will be one then the control will be moved to one then the control will be moved to one then the control will be moved to line two or our inner loop at this point line two or our inner loop at this point line two or our inner loop at this point this range function is going to generate this range function is going to generate this range function is going to generate the numbers 0 to 3 one more time so this the numbers 0 to 3 one more time so this the numbers 0 to 3 one more time so this inner loop will be executed three times inner loop will be executed three times inner loop will be executed three times and then we'll go back and then we'll go back and then we'll go back to our outer loop so this is how nested to our outer loop so this is how nested to our outer loop so this is how nested loops get executed okay here's an exercise for you but this okay here's an exercise for you but this okay here's an exercise for you but this one is a little bit more challenging one is a little bit more challenging one is a little bit more challenging than the exercises you have done so far than the exercises you have done so far than the exercises you have done so far so i really don't expect you to do it so i really don't expect you to do it so i really don't expect you to do it but if you do it wow i will be so proud but if you do it wow i will be so proud but if you do it wow i will be so proud of you of you of you so see what i have done here so see what i have done here so see what i have done here using nested loops i've written some using nested loops i've written some using nested loops i've written some code to draw this f shape can you see code to draw this f shape can you see code to draw this f shape can you see that that that so let me give you a hint so let me give you a hint so let me give you a hint first of all first of all first of all we have this list we have this list we have this list called numbers called numbers called numbers in this list we have these values 5 2 in this list we have these values 5 2 in this list we have these values 5 2 five two two five two two five two two these values determine the number of x's these values determine the number of x's these values determine the number of x's we have on each line so for example the we have on each line so for example the we have on each line so for example the first item in this list this tells us first item in this list this tells us first item in this list this tells us that we should have five x's on the that we should have five x's on the that we should have five x's on the first line there you go so one two three first line there you go so one two three first line there you go so one two three four five four five four five on the second line we're gonna have two on the second line we're gonna have two on the second line we're gonna have two excess excess excess on the third line we're gonna have five on the third line we're gonna have five on the third line we're gonna have five excess like this excess like this excess like this so i've written code to convert so i've written code to convert so i've written code to convert a simple list of numbers into a shape a simple list of numbers into a shape a simple list of numbers into a shape like this like this like this now here's a tip for you now here's a tip for you now here's a tip for you using a for loop you need to iterate using a for loop you need to iterate using a for loop you need to iterate over this list in each iteration you get over this list in each iteration you get over this list in each iteration you get one number this determines the number of one number this determines the number of one number this determines the number of excess to be displayed on that excess to be displayed on that excess to be displayed on that particular line so if you want to cheat particular line so if you want to cheat particular line so if you want to cheat you can get this number and multiply it you can get this number and multiply it you can get this number and multiply it by a string that contains x so if you by a string that contains x so if you by a string that contains x so if you multiply x by five you'll get five x's multiply x by five you'll get five x's multiply x by five you'll get five x's that's not what i want you to do i want that's not what i want you to do i want that's not what i want you to do i want you to use an inner loop here to you to use an inner loop here to you to use an inner loop here to generate a string that contains five x's generate a string that contains five x's generate a string that contains five x's so imagine in python we cannot multiply so imagine in python we cannot multiply so imagine in python we cannot multiply a string by a number so to solve this a string by a number so to solve this a string by a number so to solve this problem we need a nested loop problem we need a nested loop problem we need a nested loop so go ahead and spend five minutes on so go ahead and spend five minutes on so go ahead and spend five minutes on this exercise and by the way do your this exercise and by the way do your this exercise and by the way do your best to solve this it is a little bit best to solve this it is a little bit best to solve this it is a little bit challenging but it's not extremely challenging but it's not extremely challenging but it's not extremely difficult it just requires a little bit difficult it just requires a little bit difficult it just requires a little bit of focus you'll see my solution next all right so first we need to iterate all right so first we need to iterate all right so first we need to iterate over all the items in this list over all the items in this list over all the items in this list so for item in numbers so for item in numbers so for item in numbers or we could rename this variable to or we could rename this variable to or we could rename this variable to x underline count that is the number of x underline count that is the number of x underline count that is the number of x's on each line okay x's on each line okay x's on each line okay now i told you that if you want to cheat now i told you that if you want to cheat now i told you that if you want to cheat you can write code like this print x you can write code like this print x you can write code like this print x times x underline count if we run this times x underline count if we run this times x underline count if we run this program program program we get the same output we get the same output we get the same output so this is the beauty of python with so this is the beauty of python with so this is the beauty of python with python we can write expressions like python we can write expressions like python we can write expressions like this we can multiply a string by a this we can multiply a string by a this we can multiply a string by a number to repeat it a lot of other number to repeat it a lot of other number to repeat it a lot of other programming languages don't support this programming languages don't support this programming languages don't support this feature but for this exercise i wanted feature but for this exercise i wanted feature but for this exercise i wanted you to imagine that we don't have this you to imagine that we don't have this you to imagine that we don't have this feature in python so you would have to feature in python so you would have to feature in python so you would have to use an inner loop to solve this problem use an inner loop to solve this problem use an inner loop to solve this problem here's how it works here's how it works here's how it works in the first iteration xcount is going in the first iteration xcount is going in the first iteration xcount is going to be 5. so we need to generate five x's to be 5. so we need to generate five x's to be 5. so we need to generate five x's how can we do that well let's say we how can we do that well let's say we how can we do that well let's say we define a variable called output and define a variable called output and define a variable called output and initially we set it to an empty string initially we set it to an empty string initially we set it to an empty string now we need to add five x's to the now we need to add five x's to the now we need to add five x's to the string so we can use another loop for string so we can use another loop for string so we can use another loop for count count count in range in range in range of x underline count so we're using the of x underline count so we're using the of x underline count so we're using the range function to generate a sequence of range function to generate a sequence of range function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 numbers from 0 numbers from 0 up to x count up to x count up to x count so in our first iteration x count is so in our first iteration x count is so in our first iteration x count is going to be five so range of five would going to be five so range of five would going to be five so range of five would generate the numbers zero one two three generate the numbers zero one two three generate the numbers zero one two three four so this inner loop will be executed four so this inner loop will be executed four so this inner loop will be executed five times that is exactly what xcount five times that is exactly what xcount five times that is exactly what xcount represents represents represents so now so now so now in each iteration we simply need to in each iteration we simply need to in each iteration we simply need to append an x to our output variable so we append an x to our output variable so we append an x to our output variable so we said output said output said output plus equals x plus equals x plus equals x and then and then and then after this inner loop we simply print after this inner loop we simply print after this inner loop we simply print the output the output the output with this we'll print five excess on the with this we'll print five excess on the with this we'll print five excess on the first row then we go to the second first row then we go to the second first row then we go to the second iteration of our outer loop at this iteration of our outer loop at this iteration of our outer loop at this point xcount is going to be 2. point xcount is going to be 2. point xcount is going to be 2. now now now on line 3 we're going to reset our on line 3 we're going to reset our on line 3 we're going to reset our output variable to an empty string so we output variable to an empty string so we output variable to an empty string so we start over start over start over then we go to our inner loop this loop then we go to our inner loop this loop then we go to our inner loop this loop will be executed two times so we'll will be executed two times so we'll will be executed two times so we'll append two access to the output variable append two access to the output variable append two access to the output variable and then print it and then print it and then print it as simple as that so see it wasn't as simple as that so see it wasn't as simple as that so see it wasn't really that difficult but it was really that difficult but it was really that difficult but it was slightly more difficult than the slightly more difficult than the slightly more difficult than the previous exercises previous exercises previous exercises so let's run this program there you go so let's run this program there you go so let's run this program there you go now if you're adventurous i want you to now if you're adventurous i want you to now if you're adventurous i want you to modify the values that we have modify the values that we have modify the values that we have in our in our in our numbers list numbers list numbers list to print an l here now in this tutorial we're going to take now in this tutorial we're going to take now in this tutorial we're going to take a closer look at lists a closer look at lists a closer look at lists so i'm going to define a list of names so i'm going to define a list of names so i'm going to define a list of names let's send them to john let's send them to john let's send them to john bob bob bob marsh marsh marsh sarah and mary sarah and mary sarah and mary so if we print so if we print so if we print this list here this list here this list here what we see on the terminal looks what we see on the terminal looks what we see on the terminal looks exactly like how we define our list so exactly like how we define our list so exactly like how we define our list so we have square brackets and in between we have square brackets and in between we have square brackets and in between these square brackets we have our items these square brackets we have our items these square brackets we have our items so we have five strings in this list so we have five strings in this list so we have five strings in this list now we can also access an individual now we can also access an individual now we can also access an individual element using an index just like how we element using an index just like how we element using an index just like how we can access an individual character in a can access an individual character in a can access an individual character in a string using an index string using an index string using an index so here we type out square brackets and so here we type out square brackets and so here we type out square brackets and specify an index the index of the first specify an index the index of the first specify an index the index of the first item in this list is zero item in this list is zero item in this list is zero so let's run this program there you go so let's run this program there you go so let's run this program there you go we get john now if you want to print out we get john now if you want to print out we get john now if you want to print out the third element in this list its index the third element in this list its index the third element in this list its index is two is two is two so so so names of two names of two names of two returns mosh returns mosh returns mosh now we can also pass a negative index now we can also pass a negative index now we can also pass a negative index here so negative one refers to the last here so negative one refers to the last here so negative one refers to the last item in this list that is mary let's run item in this list that is mary let's run item in this list that is mary let's run the program the program the program there you go we see mary if you pass there you go we see mary if you pass there you go we see mary if you pass negative 2 this returns the second item negative 2 this returns the second item negative 2 this returns the second item from the end of the list from the end of the list from the end of the list so let's run the program there you go we so let's run the program there you go we so let's run the program there you go we get 0. so this is exactly like accessing get 0. so this is exactly like accessing get 0. so this is exactly like accessing individual characters in a string we can individual characters in a string we can individual characters in a string we can also also also use a colon to select a range of items use a colon to select a range of items use a colon to select a range of items for example if we pass for example if we pass for example if we pass to colon this will get all the items to colon this will get all the items to colon this will get all the items starting from the index of two that is starting from the index of two that is starting from the index of two that is mosh here all the way to the end of the mosh here all the way to the end of the mosh here all the way to the end of the string so let's run this program string so let's run this program string so let's run this program there you go there you go there you go we get this list with three items mosh we get this list with three items mosh we get this list with three items mosh sarah and mary sarah and mary sarah and mary we can also specify an end index let's we can also specify an end index let's we can also specify an end index let's say 4 so this will return all the items say 4 so this will return all the items say 4 so this will return all the items up to this index but it doesn't include up to this index but it doesn't include up to this index but it doesn't include the item at this index so when we run the item at this index so when we run the item at this index so when we run this program we only see mosh and sarah this program we only see mosh and sarah this program we only see mosh and sarah the item at index four which is the the item at index four which is the the item at index four which is the fifth element or the fifth item in this fifth element or the fifth item in this fifth element or the fifth item in this list is not returned so mary is not list is not returned so mary is not list is not returned so mary is not returned okay and also here we have returned okay and also here we have returned okay and also here we have default values so if we leave out the default values so if we leave out the default values so if we leave out the end index this expression is going to end index this expression is going to end index this expression is going to return all the items starting from the return all the items starting from the return all the items starting from the index of two to the end of the list or index of two to the end of the list or index of two to the end of the list or if we leave out the start index this if we leave out the start index this if we leave out the start index this expression assumes zero as the default expression assumes zero as the default expression assumes zero as the default index so it will return all the items index so it will return all the items index so it will return all the items from the beginning to the end of the from the beginning to the end of the from the beginning to the end of the list okay and by the way just like list okay and by the way just like list okay and by the way just like strings these square brackets here don't strings these square brackets here don't strings these square brackets here don't modify our original list they simply modify our original list they simply modify our original list they simply return a new list for example if we pass return a new list for example if we pass return a new list for example if we pass two here two here two here you can see this returns a new list with you can see this returns a new list with you can see this returns a new list with three items so if we go back here and three items so if we go back here and three items so if we go back here and print our original list of names right print our original list of names right print our original list of names right after after after you can see it's not affected so you can see it's not affected so you can see it's not affected so whenever we use square brackets with a whenever we use square brackets with a whenever we use square brackets with a colon to select a range of items we get colon to select a range of items we get colon to select a range of items we get a new list and by the way we can also a new list and by the way we can also a new list and by the way we can also modify any of the elements in this list modify any of the elements in this list modify any of the elements in this list for example let's say we made a mistake for example let's say we made a mistake for example let's say we made a mistake and the first item shouldn't be spelled and the first item shouldn't be spelled and the first item shouldn't be spelled john with an h so we want to remove the john with an h so we want to remove the john with an h so we want to remove the h that is very easy so we access it h that is very easy so we access it h that is very easy so we access it using an index that is names of zero and using an index that is names of zero and using an index that is names of zero and we set it to a new value we set it to a new value we set it to a new value like this like this like this now let's print our list now let's print our list now let's print our list so you can see so you can see so you can see the first item in this list is now the first item in this list is now the first item in this list is now updated so this is the basics of lists updated so this is the basics of lists updated so this is the basics of lists and here's an exercise for you i want and here's an exercise for you i want and here's an exercise for you i want you to write a program to find the you to write a program to find the you to write a program to find the largest number in the list this is a largest number in the list this is a largest number in the list this is a fantastic exercise for beginners so go fantastic exercise for beginners so go fantastic exercise for beginners so go ahead and spend a few minutes on this ahead and spend a few minutes on this ahead and spend a few minutes on this and then come back continue watching all right let's define a list of numbers all right let's define a list of numbers all right let's define a list of numbers numbers numbers numbers with a bunch of random numbers 3 6 2 8 4 with a bunch of random numbers 3 6 2 8 4 with a bunch of random numbers 3 6 2 8 4 and 10. and 10. and 10. now to find the largest number in this now to find the largest number in this now to find the largest number in this list we need to define another variable list we need to define another variable list we need to define another variable let's call it max this variable will let's call it max this variable will let's call it max this variable will hold the largest number now initially we hold the largest number now initially we hold the largest number now initially we want to assume that the first item in want to assume that the first item in want to assume that the first item in this list this list this list is the largest number so we set max to is the largest number so we set max to is the largest number so we set max to numbers numbers numbers of zero we're only assuming that the of zero we're only assuming that the of zero we're only assuming that the first item is the largest number chances first item is the largest number chances first item is the largest number chances are our assumption is wrong so we need are our assumption is wrong so we need are our assumption is wrong so we need to iterate over this list we need to to iterate over this list we need to to iterate over this list we need to loop through it loop through it loop through it get each item and compare it with max get each item and compare it with max get each item and compare it with max if it's greater than max then we need to if it's greater than max then we need to if it's greater than max then we need to reset max to that number so in the first reset max to that number so in the first reset max to that number so in the first iteration we get 3 and max is also 3. iteration we get 3 and max is also 3. iteration we get 3 and max is also 3. is 3 greater than 3 no so we move on we is 3 greater than 3 no so we move on we is 3 greater than 3 no so we move on we get the second number is 6 greater than get the second number is 6 greater than get the second number is 6 greater than 3 it is so we need to reset max to 6. 3 it is so we need to reset max to 6. 3 it is so we need to reset max to 6. once again we continue we get 2 is 2 once again we continue we get 2 is 2 once again we continue we get 2 is 2 greater than 6 no it's not so we move on greater than 6 no it's not so we move on greater than 6 no it's not so we move on then we get 8 is 8 greater than six it then we get 8 is 8 greater than six it then we get 8 is 8 greater than six it is so we should reset max to eight that is so we should reset max to eight that is so we should reset max to eight that is pretty easy is pretty easy is pretty easy so here we need a for loop for number so here we need a for loop for number so here we need a for loop for number in numbers colon in numbers colon in numbers colon now we need to check to see if this now we need to check to see if this now we need to check to see if this number is greater than max number is greater than max number is greater than max so so so if number if number if number is greater than max colon is greater than max colon is greater than max colon then we need to reset max so we set max then we need to reset max so we set max then we need to reset max so we set max to this new number to this new number to this new number that's all we had to do so let's print that's all we had to do so let's print that's all we had to do so let's print max max max and run our program and run our program and run our program we can say the largest number in this we can say the largest number in this we can say the largest number in this list is 10. it doesn't matter whether list is 10. it doesn't matter whether list is 10. it doesn't matter whether this number is at the end of the list or this number is at the end of the list or this number is at the end of the list or at the beginning so if i move 10 at the beginning so if i move 10 at the beginning so if i move 10 and put it right at the beginning and put it right at the beginning and put it right at the beginning we should still see the same result we should still see the same result we should still see the same result let's run our program we still see 10 if let's run our program we still see 10 if let's run our program we still see 10 if i put this somewhere in the middle i put this somewhere in the middle i put this somewhere in the middle our program should still work let's put our program should still work let's put our program should still work let's put it right after it right after it right after two two two run the program we still get 10. in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about two-dimensional lists in you guys about two-dimensional lists in you guys about two-dimensional lists in python two-dimensional lists are python two-dimensional lists are python two-dimensional lists are extremely powerful and they have a lot extremely powerful and they have a lot extremely powerful and they have a lot of applications in data science and of applications in data science and of applications in data science and machine learning here's an example in machine learning here's an example in machine learning here's an example in math we have a concept called matrix math we have a concept called matrix math we have a concept called matrix which is like a rectangular array of which is like a rectangular array of which is like a rectangular array of numbers let me show you so yeah one two numbers let me show you so yeah one two numbers let me show you so yeah one two three four five six seven eight nine so three four five six seven eight nine so three four five six seven eight nine so we have a rectangular array of numbers we have a rectangular array of numbers we have a rectangular array of numbers we have rows we have rows we have rows and columns so this is a three by three and columns so this is a three by three and columns so this is a three by three matrix in math now we can model this in matrix in math now we can model this in matrix in math now we can model this in python using a two-dimensional list a python using a two-dimensional list a python using a two-dimensional list a two-dimensional list is a list where two-dimensional list is a list where two-dimensional list is a list where each item in that list is another list each item in that list is another list each item in that list is another list so so so you want to define a matrix we set it to you want to define a matrix we set it to you want to define a matrix we set it to a list a list a list each item in this list is going to be each item in this list is going to be each item in this list is going to be another list and that list represents another list and that list represents another list and that list represents the items in each row the items in each row the items in each row so the first item in our list is going so the first item in our list is going so the first item in our list is going to be another list and in this list to be another list and in this list to be another list and in this list we're going to have the values 1 2 and we're going to have the values 1 2 and we're going to have the values 1 2 and 3. 3. 3. now the second item in our matrix list now the second item in our matrix list now the second item in our matrix list once again we have a list this list once again we have a list this list once again we have a list this list represents the items in the second row represents the items in the second row represents the items in the second row so so so 4 5 and 6 and finally 4 5 and 6 and finally 4 5 and 6 and finally 7 8 9. 7 8 9. 7 8 9. so as you can see we have a so as you can see we have a so as you can see we have a two-dimensional list each item two-dimensional list each item two-dimensional list each item in our outer list is another list in our outer list is another list in our outer list is another list okay so this is how we can implement a okay so this is how we can implement a okay so this is how we can implement a matrix in python now to access an matrix in python now to access an matrix in python now to access an individual item in our matrix once again individual item in our matrix once again individual item in our matrix once again we use square brackets let me delete we use square brackets let me delete we use square brackets let me delete this stuff this stuff this stuff all right all right all right so how do we access one here well so how do we access one here well so how do we access one here well we start with our list we start with our list we start with our list then we add square brackets first we then we add square brackets first we then we add square brackets first we need to go and get the first item in need to go and get the first item in need to go and get the first item in this list right so we pass zero now this this list right so we pass zero now this this list right so we pass zero now this expression returns another list that is expression returns another list that is expression returns another list that is the inner list the inner list the inner list in this list let's say we want to access in this list let's say we want to access in this list let's say we want to access the second item the second item the second item so so so once again we add square brackets and we once again we add square brackets and we once again we add square brackets and we pass one that is the index pass one that is the index pass one that is the index of two in this list right of two in this list right of two in this list right so if we print this on the terminal so if we print this on the terminal so if we print this on the terminal we get two okay so using two square we get two okay so using two square we get two okay so using two square brackets we can access individual items brackets we can access individual items brackets we can access individual items in our matrix and also we can modify in our matrix and also we can modify in our matrix and also we can modify these values using this syntax so these values using this syntax so these values using this syntax so before printing this let's change it to before printing this let's change it to before printing this let's change it to 20. so matrix of 0 and 1 let's change it 20. so matrix of 0 and 1 let's change it 20. so matrix of 0 and 1 let's change it to 20 to 20 to 20 and then print it there you go it's and then print it there you go it's and then print it there you go it's modified modified modified now here we can also use nested loops to now here we can also use nested loops to now here we can also use nested loops to iterate over all the items in this iterate over all the items in this iterate over all the items in this matrix let me show you so matrix let me show you so matrix let me show you so we start with the rows for row we start with the rows for row we start with the rows for row in matrix in matrix in matrix so with this loop we are iterating over so with this loop we are iterating over so with this loop we are iterating over our matrix list in each iteration row our matrix list in each iteration row our matrix list in each iteration row will contain one list one item okay will contain one list one item okay will contain one list one item okay now now now here we need to use an inner loop here we need to use an inner loop here we need to use an inner loop so we need to loop over this row which so we need to loop over this row which so we need to loop over this row which is a list of items is a list of items is a list of items we can type out four we can type out four we can type out four item in row colon item in row colon item in row colon and print item and print item and print item okay okay okay so let's run this program so let's run this program so let's run this program there you go we get all the items there you go we get all the items there you go we get all the items in our list hey i just wanted to make a quick hey i just

link is below this video click the link and get started in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about the list methods or list you guys about the list methods or list you guys about the list methods or list functions these are the operations that functions these are the operations that functions these are the operations that we can perform on a list so let's define we can perform on a list so let's define we can perform on a list so let's define a list of numbers a list of numbers a list of numbers here we pass a bunch of random numbers here we pass a bunch of random numbers here we pass a bunch of random numbers like 5 like 5 like 5 1 7 and 4. 1 7 and 4. 1 7 and 4. now there are a number of things we can now there are a number of things we can now there are a number of things we can do with this list we can add new items do with this list we can add new items do with this list we can add new items to it we can remove existing items we to it we can remove existing items we to it we can remove existing items we can check for the existence of an item can check for the existence of an item can check for the existence of an item these are the operations that we can these are the operations that we can these are the operations that we can perform on a list so when we type perform on a list so when we type perform on a list so when we type numbers numbers numbers dot we can see all these functions or dot we can see all these functions or dot we can see all these functions or more accurately the methods that are more accurately the methods that are more accurately the methods that are available in our list objects available in our list objects available in our list objects so we can call the append method to add so we can call the append method to add so we can call the append method to add a new item to this list let's say a new item to this list let's say a new item to this list let's say 13 actually no it's not a good number 13 actually no it's not a good number 13 actually no it's not a good number i'm joking i'm not superstitious so i'm joking i'm not superstitious so i'm joking i'm not superstitious so let's add 20. let's add 20. let's add 20. it doesn't really matter and then print it doesn't really matter and then print it doesn't really matter and then print our list our list our list when we run the program you can see when we run the program you can see when we run the program you can see 20 is added at the end of this list but 20 is added at the end of this list but 20 is added at the end of this list but what if you want to add a number what if you want to add a number what if you want to add a number somewhere in the middle or at the somewhere in the middle or at the somewhere in the middle or at the beginning of our list for that we use a beginning of our list for that we use a beginning of our list for that we use a different method that is called insert different method that is called insert different method that is called insert so so so insert now this method takes two values insert now this method takes two values insert now this method takes two values let me show you so when we open let me show you so when we open let me show you so when we open parenthesis parenthesis parenthesis look at this little tooltip above the look at this little tooltip above the look at this little tooltip above the insert method insert method insert method you see the first value that we need to you see the first value that we need to you see the first value that we need to pass here is an index so this is the pass here is an index so this is the pass here is an index so this is the index at which we want to insert this index at which we want to insert this index at which we want to insert this new item let's say we want to add an new item let's say we want to add an new item let's say we want to add an item at the beginning of our list so we item at the beginning of our list so we item at the beginning of our list so we pass the index position of zero pass the index position of zero pass the index position of zero and then the second value is the actual and then the second value is the actual and then the second value is the actual object we want to add to this list let's object we want to add to this list let's object we want to add to this list let's say we want to add the number 10. say we want to add the number 10. say we want to add the number 10. now when we print this list you can see now when we print this list you can see now when we print this list you can see that the number 10 that the number 10 that the number 10 is placed at the beginning of the list is placed at the beginning of the list is placed at the beginning of the list and all the other items are pushed to and all the other items are pushed to and all the other items are pushed to the right the right the right we can also remove an item so we call we can also remove an item so we call we can also remove an item so we call remove and pass the item that we want to remove and pass the item that we want to remove and pass the item that we want to remove let's say we want to remove five remove let's say we want to remove five remove let's say we want to remove five now we print our list so you can see now we print our list so you can see now we print our list so you can see five is gone and we have two one seven five is gone and we have two one seven five is gone and we have two one seven four if you wanna remove all the items four if you wanna remove all the items four if you wanna remove all the items in the list you can call the clear in the list you can call the clear in the list you can call the clear method so method so method so clear clear clear this method doesn't take any values so this method doesn't take any values so this method doesn't take any values so we simply call it and it empties our we simply call it and it empties our we simply call it and it empties our list list list all the items are removed all the items are removed all the items are removed we also have another useful method we also have another useful method we also have another useful method called pop called pop called pop and with this we can remove the last and with this we can remove the last and with this we can remove the last item in a list let me show you so run item in a list let me show you so run item in a list let me show you so run our program you can see the number four our program you can see the number four our program you can see the number four is removed from the end of our list is removed from the end of our list is removed from the end of our list now if you want to check for the now if you want to check for the now if you want to check for the existence of an item in a list you can existence of an item in a list you can existence of an item in a list you can call the index method so call the index method so call the index method so we call index we call index we call index and pass the value here like five and and pass the value here like five and and pass the value here like five and this returns the index of the first this returns the index of the first this returns the index of the first occurrence of this item so let's print occurrence of this item so let's print occurrence of this item so let's print this on the terminal this on the terminal this on the terminal we don't need this line anymore we don't need this line anymore we don't need this line anymore so the index of five is zero what if we so the index of five is zero what if we so the index of five is zero what if we pass a number that doesn't exist in this pass a number that doesn't exist in this pass a number that doesn't exist in this list let's say 50. list let's say 50. list let's say 50. run the program run the program run the program we get an error we got a value error 50 we get an error we got a value error 50 we get an error we got a value error 50 is not in the list is not in the list is not in the list there is also another way to check for there is also another way to check for there is also another way to check for the existence of an item we can use the the existence of an item we can use the the existence of an item we can use the in operator so in operator so in operator so let me show you we type out 15 in let me show you we type out 15 in let me show you we type out 15 in numbers numbers numbers earlier we used the in operator with a earlier we used the in operator with a earlier we used the in operator with a string we could check for the existence string we could check for the existence string we could check for the existence of a character or a sequence of of a character or a sequence of of a character or a sequence of characters in a string characters in a string characters in a string now here we're checking for the now here we're checking for the now here we're checking for the existence of 50 in the list of numbers existence of 50 in the list of numbers existence of 50 in the list of numbers so let's print this so let's print this so let's print this we get a boolean value false so unlike we get a boolean value false so unlike we get a boolean value false so unlike the index method this expression doesn't the index method this expression doesn't the index method this expression doesn't generate an error so it's safer to use generate an error so it's safer to use generate an error so it's safer to use this we also have another method for this we also have another method for this we also have another method for counting the occurrences of an item counting the occurrences of an item counting the occurrences of an item let's say we have another five let's say we have another five let's say we have another five over over over here now we can call here now we can call here now we can call numbers that count and pass five and numbers that count and pass five and numbers that count and pass five and this should return two because we have this should return two because we have this should return two because we have two fives in this list take a look there two fives in this list take a look there two fives in this list take a look there you go you go you go that is pretty useful now if you want to that is pretty useful now if you want to that is pretty useful now if you want to sort your lists you can call the sort sort your lists you can call the sort sort your lists you can call the sort method so method so method so we call the sort method here this method we call the sort method here this method we call the sort method here this method doesn't take any values so doesn't take any values so doesn't take any values so look at the return value that is none look at the return value that is none look at the return value that is none none is an object in python that none is an object in python that none is an object in python that represents the absence of a value represents the absence of a value represents the absence of a value so this sort method doesn't really so this sort method doesn't really so this sort method doesn't really return any values it simply sorts this return any values it simply sorts this return any values it simply sorts this list in place so instead of printing the list in place so instead of printing the list in place so instead of printing the return value of this method return value of this method return value of this method we simply call it to sort our list and we simply call it to sort our list and we simply call it to sort our list and then print our list then print our list then print our list take a look take a look take a look now all the items are sorted in now all the items are sorted in now all the items are sorted in ascending order we can also sort the ascending order we can also sort the ascending order we can also sort the items in descending order so after we items in descending order so after we items in descending order so after we sort the list we can call sort the list we can call sort the list we can call the reverse method and this simply the reverse method and this simply the reverse method and this simply reverses our list reverses our list reverses our list now let's go ahead and run our program now let's go ahead and run our program now let's go ahead and run our program take a look take a look take a look our numbers are sorted in descending our numbers are sorted in descending our numbers are sorted in descending order order order and one last method i want to show you and one last method i want to show you and one last method i want to show you here that is pretty useful is the copy here that is pretty useful is the copy here that is pretty useful is the copy method so copy method so copy method so copy with this method we can get a copy of with this method we can get a copy of with this method we can get a copy of our list so let's define another our list so let's define another our list so let's define another variable called numbers2 variable called numbers2 variable called numbers2 now numbers2 is a copy of our original now numbers2 is a copy of our original now numbers2 is a copy of our original list so if you make any changes to our list so if you make any changes to our list so if you make any changes to our original list if you add new items to it original list if you add new items to it original list if you add new items to it if you remove existing items these if you remove existing items these if you remove existing items these operations are not going to impact our operations are not going to impact our operations are not going to impact our second list let me show you so after we second list let me show you so after we second list let me show you so after we take a copy of our numbers list take a copy of our numbers list take a copy of our numbers list let's add a new item to this list some let's add a new item to this list some let's add a new item to this list some numbers that append 10. numbers that append 10. numbers that append 10. so the first list is updated so now we so the first list is updated so now we so the first list is updated so now we have a new item in our first list have a new item in our first list have a new item in our first list then let's print the second list then let's print the second list then let's print the second list take a look we don't have the number 10 take a look we don't have the number 10 take a look we don't have the number 10 here because these are two independent here because these are two independent here because these are two independent lists lists lists so these are all the operations that we so these are all the operations that we so these are all the operations that we can perform on lists we can add new can perform on lists we can add new can perform on lists we can add new items to a list we can remove existing items to a list we can remove existing items to a list we can remove existing items we can check for the existence of items we can check for the existence of items we can check for the existence of an item we can sort our lists and copy an item we can sort our lists and copy an item we can sort our lists and copy them them them now here is the exercise for this now here is the exercise for this now here is the exercise for this tutorial i want you to write a program tutorial i want you to write a program tutorial i want you to write a program to remove the duplicates in a list again to remove the duplicates in a list again to remove the duplicates in a list again this is a fantastic exercise so spend a this is a fantastic exercise so spend a this is a fantastic exercise so spend a few minutes on this and then come back few minutes on this and then come back few minutes on this and then come back continue watching all right let's say we have a list of all right let's say we have a list of all right let's say we have a list of numbers with a bunch of duplicates so 2 numbers with a bunch of duplicates so 2 numbers with a bunch of duplicates so 2 4 6 3 4 4 6 3 4 4 6 3 4 6 1. 6 1. 6 1. we want to remove the duplicates we want to remove the duplicates we want to remove the duplicates so we need to define another list let's so we need to define another list let's so we need to define another list let's call that unix call that unix call that unix initially we set it to an empty list initially we set it to an empty list initially we set it to an empty list then we need to iterate over then we need to iterate over then we need to iterate over our first list get each item and if we our first list get each item and if we our first list get each item and if we don't have that number in this unix list don't have that number in this unix list don't have that number in this unix list then we'll add it to the second list as then we'll add it to the second list as then we'll add it to the second list as simple as that so simple as that so simple as that so for number in numbers for number in numbers for number in numbers now we need to check to see if we have now we need to check to see if we have now we need to check to see if we have this number this number this number in the second list in the second list in the second list so we use the in operator so we use the in operator so we use the in operator if if if number number number not in unix not in unix not in unix so note that here we are using the not so note that here we are using the not so note that here we are using the not operator so if we don't have this number operator so if we don't have this number operator so if we don't have this number in this unix list in this unix list in this unix list then we'll need to add it so then we'll need to add it so then we'll need to add it so unix dot append unix dot append unix dot append number number number that's all we have to do that's all we have to do that's all we have to do so let's go ahead and print the unix so let's go ahead and print the unix so let's go ahead and print the unix list list list there you go so we have two four six there you go so we have two four six there you go so we have two four six three and 1. the duplicates are removed in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about another important you guys about another important you guys about another important structure in python called topo tuples structure in python called topo tuples structure in python called topo tuples are similar to lists so we can use them are similar to lists so we can use them are similar to lists so we can use them to store a list of items but unlike to store a list of items but unlike to store a list of items but unlike lists we cannot modify them we cannot lists we cannot modify them we cannot lists we cannot modify them we cannot add new items we cannot remove existing add new items we cannot remove existing add new items we cannot remove existing items we say tuples are immutable we items we say tuples are immutable we items we say tuples are immutable we cannot mutate or change them let me show cannot mutate or change them let me show cannot mutate or change them let me show you so i'm going to start by defining a you so i'm going to start by defining a you so i'm going to start by defining a list of numbers one two three list of numbers one two three list of numbers one two three so we use square brackets to define so we use square brackets to define so we use square brackets to define lists and parentheses to define tuples lists and parentheses to define tuples lists and parentheses to define tuples so if we change this to so if we change this to so if we change this to parenthesis one two three now we have a parenthesis one two three now we have a parenthesis one two three now we have a tuple so if we type numbers dot look tuple so if we type numbers dot look tuple so if we type numbers dot look here we don't have the append or insert here we don't have the append or insert here we don't have the append or insert methods so we cannot add new items to methods so we cannot add new items to methods so we cannot add new items to this tuple we also don't have remove this tuple we also don't have remove this tuple we also don't have remove clear and pop we cannot remove any of clear and pop we cannot remove any of clear and pop we cannot remove any of these items here these items here these items here we only have two methods count and index we only have two methods count and index we only have two methods count and index we use count to count the number of we use count to count the number of we use count to count the number of occurrences of an item and index to find occurrences of an item and index to find occurrences of an item and index to find the index of the first occurrence of an the index of the first occurrence of an the index of the first occurrence of an item so we can only get information item so we can only get information item so we can only get information about a tuple we cannot change it and by about a tuple we cannot change it and by about a tuple we cannot change it and by the way these other methods that you see the way these other methods that you see the way these other methods that you see here they start with two underscores we here they start with two underscores we here they start with two underscores we refer to this as magic methods they're refer to this as magic methods they're refer to this as magic methods they're more of an advanced topic so they go more of an advanced topic so they go more of an advanced topic so they go beyond the scope of this tutorial if beyond the scope of this tutorial if beyond the scope of this tutorial if you're interested to learn about them you're interested to learn about them you're interested to learn about them you can get my python course i've you can get my python course i've you can get my python course i've covered them in detail covered them in detail covered them in detail so similar to lists we can access so similar to lists we can access so similar to lists we can access individual items using square brackets individual items using square brackets individual items using square brackets so we can get the first item like this so we can get the first item like this so we can get the first item like this and then print it on the terminal and then print it on the terminal and then print it on the terminal there you go the first item is one there you go the first item is one there you go the first item is one but if you try to change the first item but if you try to change the first item but if you try to change the first item we'll get an error so numbers of zero we we'll get an error so numbers of zero we we'll get an error so numbers of zero we set it to 10 set it to 10 set it to 10 and run our program there you go we get and run our program there you go we get and run our program there you go we get this type error because the tuple object this type error because the tuple object this type error because the tuple object does not support item assignment does not support item assignment does not support item assignment so we cannot mutate or change tuples so we cannot mutate or change tuples so we cannot mutate or change tuples they are immutable they are immutable they are immutable now practically speaking most of the now practically speaking most of the now practically speaking most of the time you will be using lists but tuples time you will be using lists but tuples time you will be using lists but tuples are also useful if you want to create a are also useful if you want to create a are also useful if you want to create a list of items and you want to make sure list of items and you want to make sure list of items and you want to make sure that nowhere in your program you that nowhere in your program you that nowhere in your program you accidentally modify that list then it's accidentally modify that list then it's accidentally modify that list then it's better to use a tuple in this tutorial i'm going to show you a in this tutorial i'm going to show you a in this tutorial i'm going to show you a powerful feature we have in python powerful feature we have in python powerful feature we have in python called unpacking so let's define a tuple called unpacking so let's define a tuple called unpacking so let's define a tuple called coordinates called coordinates called coordinates and here we pass three values one two and here we pass three values one two and here we pass three values one two three so imagine these are the three so imagine these are the three so imagine these are the coordinates for x y and z coordinates for x y and z coordinates for x y and z now let's say we want to get these now let's say we want to get these now let's say we want to get these values and use them in a few expressions values and use them in a few expressions values and use them in a few expressions in a few complex expressions in our in a few complex expressions in our in a few complex expressions in our program maybe we want to include them as program maybe we want to include them as program maybe we want to include them as part of a large complex formula so part of a large complex formula so part of a large complex formula so together we'll have to write code like together we'll have to write code like together we'll have to write code like this coordinates of zero then let's say this coordinates of zero then let's say this coordinates of zero then let's say we want to multiply this by coordinates we want to multiply this by coordinates we want to multiply this by coordinates of one and then multiply it by of one and then multiply it by of one and then multiply it by coordinates of two coordinates of two coordinates of two our code is getting a little bit too our code is getting a little bit too our code is getting a little bit too long this is just a very simple example long this is just a very simple example long this is just a very simple example but let's say we want to use these but let's say we want to use these but let's say we want to use these values in quite a few places in our values in quite a few places in our values in quite a few places in our program so a better approach is to get program so a better approach is to get program so a better approach is to get these values and store them in separate these values and store them in separate these values and store them in separate variables like variables like variables like we can get coordinates of 0 and store it we can get coordinates of 0 and store it we can get coordinates of 0 and store it in x in x in x then we get coordinates then we get coordinates then we get coordinates a 1 a 1 a 1 and store it in y and store it in y and store it in y and similarly we get coordinates of 2 and similarly we get coordinates of 2 and similarly we get coordinates of 2 and then store it in z and then store it in z and then store it in z now instead of repeating coordinates of now instead of repeating coordinates of now instead of repeating coordinates of 2 or coordinates of 0 multiple times we 2 or coordinates of 0 multiple times we 2 or coordinates of 0 multiple times we can simply work with these variables x can simply work with these variables x can simply work with these variables x times y times z times y times z times y times z that is better right that is better right that is better right so nothing new so far but in python we so nothing new so far but in python we so nothing new so far but in python we have a powerful feature called unpacking have a powerful feature called unpacking have a powerful feature called unpacking and with that we can achieve the same and with that we can achieve the same and with that we can achieve the same result with far less code so we can result with far less code so we can result with far less code so we can define our variables x y define our variables x y define our variables x y and z and z and z and set them to our tuple and set them to our tuple and set them to our tuple what we have on line six is exactly what we have on line six is exactly what we have on line six is exactly identical to what we have on lines two identical to what we have on lines two identical to what we have on lines two to four to four to four so this is a shorthand to achieve the so this is a shorthand to achieve the so this is a shorthand to achieve the same result same result same result so let me delete this and explain how so let me delete this and explain how so let me delete this and explain how this code works when python interpreter this code works when python interpreter this code works when python interpreter sees this statement it will get the sees this statement it will get the sees this statement it will get the first item in this tuple and assign it first item in this tuple and assign it first item in this tuple and assign it to this variable then it will get the to this variable then it will get the to this variable then it will get the second item in this tuple and assign it second item in this tuple and assign it second item in this tuple and assign it to the second variable and similarly it to the second variable and similarly it to the second variable and similarly it will get the third item in this top hole will get the third item in this top hole will get the third item in this top hole and assign it to the third variable we and assign it to the third variable we and assign it to the third variable we have here have here have here so we are unpacking this tuple into so we are unpacking this tuple into so we are unpacking this tuple into three variables three variables three variables now if we print now if we print now if we print x you can see x you can see x you can see x is one similarly y x is one similarly y x is one similarly y is two there you go is two there you go is two there you go so this is unpacking and by the way this so this is unpacking and by the way this so this is unpacking and by the way this is not limited to tuples we can use this is not limited to tuples we can use this is not limited to tuples we can use this feature with lists as well so if i feature with lists as well so if i feature with lists as well so if i change parenthesis change parenthesis change parenthesis to square brackets to square brackets to square brackets now coordinates is a list so we can now coordinates is a list so we can now coordinates is a list so we can unpack this list into three variables unpack this list into three variables unpack this list into three variables now now now run our program you can see y is two in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about dictionaries in python we you guys about dictionaries in python we you guys about dictionaries in python we use dictionaries in situations where we use dictionaries in situations where we use dictionaries in situations where we want to store information that come as want to store information that come as want to store information that come as key value pairs here's an example think key value pairs here's an example think key value pairs here's an example think of a customer a customer has a bunch of of a customer a customer has a bunch of of a customer a customer has a bunch of attributes like name attributes like name attributes like name email email email phone number address and so on but each phone number address and so on but each phone number address and so on but each of these attributes has a value for of these attributes has a value for of these attributes has a value for example the name can be john smith the example the name can be john smith the example the name can be john smith the email can be john gmail.com email can be john gmail.com email can be john gmail.com the phone can be whatever so what we the phone can be whatever so what we the phone can be whatever so what we have here is a bunch of key value pairs have here is a bunch of key value pairs have here is a bunch of key value pairs so in this example our keys are name so in this example our keys are name so in this example our keys are name email and phone and each key is email and phone and each key is email and phone and each key is associated with a value so this is where associated with a value so this is where associated with a value so this is where we use a dictionary with a dictionary we we use a dictionary with a dictionary we we use a dictionary with a dictionary we can store a bunch of key value pairs can store a bunch of key value pairs can store a bunch of key value pairs so let me show you how to define a so let me show you how to define a so let me show you how to define a dictionary in python back to our program dictionary in python back to our program dictionary in python back to our program i'm going to define a variable customer i'm going to define a variable customer i'm going to define a variable customer and here we set it to curly braces with and here we set it to curly braces with and here we set it to curly braces with these curly braces we can define a these curly braces we can define a these curly braces we can define a dictionary in this example we have an dictionary in this example we have an dictionary in this example we have an empty dictionary that doesn't have any empty dictionary that doesn't have any empty dictionary that doesn't have any key value pairs now we can add one or key value pairs now we can add one or key value pairs now we can add one or more key value pairs in between the more key value pairs in between the more key value pairs in between the braces so let's add a key value pair braces so let's add a key value pair braces so let's add a key value pair here here here i'm going to set the key to name i'm going to set the key to name i'm going to set the key to name and the value to john smith and the value to john smith and the value to john smith then we add a comma to add another key then we add a comma to add another key then we add a comma to add another key value pair so let's set value pair so let's set value pair so let's set age to 30. age to 30. age to 30. let's add another key value pair is let's add another key value pair is let's add another key value pair is underline verified underline verified underline verified and we set this to a boolean and we set this to a boolean and we set this to a boolean now what matters here is that these keys now what matters here is that these keys now what matters here is that these keys should be unique so if i add another key should be unique so if i add another key should be unique so if i add another key value pair here value pair here value pair here let's set age let's set age let's set age to to to 40. 40. 40. now look pycharm has highlighted the h now look pycharm has highlighted the h now look pycharm has highlighted the h key because we have duplicated that and key because we have duplicated that and key because we have duplicated that and that's not allowed so each key should be that's not allowed so each key should be that's not allowed so each key should be unique in a dictionary just like the unique in a dictionary just like the unique in a dictionary just like the dictionaries we have in the real world dictionaries we have in the real world dictionaries we have in the real world in a real dictionary we have a bunch of in a real dictionary we have a bunch of in a real dictionary we have a bunch of words and their definition each word is words and their definition each word is words and their definition each word is listed only once in a dictionary we listed only once in a dictionary we listed only once in a dictionary we don't have the word book twice don't have the word book twice don't have the word book twice so let's delete this second duplicate so let's delete this second duplicate so let's delete this second duplicate key value pair key value pair key value pair so the keys should be unique and in this so the keys should be unique and in this so the keys should be unique and in this example i'm using strings but they can example i'm using strings but they can example i'm using strings but they can also be numbers we're going to look at also be numbers we're going to look at also be numbers we're going to look at that later that later that later but the value can be anything it can be but the value can be anything it can be but the value can be anything it can be a string a number a boolean a list a string a number a boolean a list a string a number a boolean a list literally anything literally anything literally anything now we can access each item in this now we can access each item in this now we can access each item in this dictionary using square brackets so dictionary using square brackets so dictionary using square brackets so we type customer we type customer we type customer square bracket and then specify a key square bracket and then specify a key square bracket and then specify a key like name like name like name and this will return the value and this will return the value and this will return the value associated with the name key let's print associated with the name key let's print associated with the name key let's print it on the terminal have a look it on the terminal have a look it on the terminal have a look there you go so there you go so there you go so the name is john smith now what if we the name is john smith now what if we the name is john smith now what if we pass a key that doesn't exist pass a key that doesn't exist pass a key that doesn't exist let's say let's say let's say birth date birth date birth date run the program we get a key error run the program we get a key error run the program we get a key error because we don't have a key called birth because we don't have a key called birth because we don't have a key called birth date also date also date also if we spell name if we spell name if we spell name with let's say a capital n we get the with let's say a capital n we get the with let's say a capital n we get the same error because we don't have a key same error because we don't have a key same error because we don't have a key with the exact with the exact with the exact same sequence of characters in this same sequence of characters in this same sequence of characters in this dictionary dictionary dictionary now to get around this we can use the now to get around this we can use the now to get around this we can use the get method let me show you get method let me show you get method let me show you so instead of using the square brackets so instead of using the square brackets so instead of using the square brackets we call the get method and specify we call the get method and specify we call the get method and specify our key our key our key now if we use a key that doesn't exist now if we use a key that doesn't exist now if we use a key that doesn't exist here it doesn't yell at us for example here it doesn't yell at us for example here it doesn't yell at us for example if you pass birth date if you pass birth date if you pass birth date it simply returns the non-value earlier it simply returns the non-value earlier it simply returns the non-value earlier i told you that none is an object that i told you that none is an object that i told you that none is an object that represents the absence of a value represents the absence of a value represents the absence of a value so instead of getting a key error we get so instead of getting a key error we get so instead of getting a key error we get none now we can also optionally supply a none now we can also optionally supply a none now we can also optionally supply a default value for example if this default value for example if this default value for example if this dictionary doesn't have this key we can dictionary doesn't have this key we can dictionary doesn't have this key we can supply a default value let's say supply a default value let's say supply a default value let's say january 1st 1980. january 1st 1980. january 1st 1980. let's run the program let's run the program let's run the program now instead of getting none we get this now instead of getting none we get this now instead of getting none we get this default value default value default value so this is how we can access the value so this is how we can access the value so this is how we can access the value associated with the key in a dictionary associated with the key in a dictionary associated with the key in a dictionary we can also update these values for we can also update these values for we can also update these values for example before our print statement we example before our print statement we example before our print statement we can write code like this customer can write code like this customer can write code like this customer of name of name of name let's update the name to let's update the name to let's update the name to jack smith jack smith jack smith now this little warning here is telling now this little warning here is telling now this little warning here is telling us that we could simply put jack smith us that we could simply put jack smith us that we could simply put jack smith here instead of defining it once and here instead of defining it once and here instead of defining it once and then update it don't worry about that it then update it don't worry about that it then update it don't worry about that it doesn't really matter now with this line doesn't really matter now with this line doesn't really matter now with this line if we print the name of this customer we if we print the name of this customer we if we print the name of this customer we should see jack smith let me show you so should see jack smith let me show you so should see jack smith let me show you so i'm going to use the square bracket i'm going to use the square bracket i'm going to use the square bracket notation again let's print the name of notation again let's print the name of notation again let's print the name of the customer you can see the customer you can see the customer you can see that is updated here we can also add a that is updated here we can also add a that is updated here we can also add a new key here new key here new key here let's set the birth date let's set the birth date let's set the birth date to some value like to some value like to some value like january 1st 1980 january 1st 1980 january 1st 1980 and then we can print it here and then we can print it here and then we can print it here so as you see we can easily add new key so as you see we can easily add new key so as you see we can easily add new key value pairs to a dictionary value pairs to a dictionary value pairs to a dictionary so this is the basics of using so this is the basics of using so this is the basics of using dictionaries in python they're extremely dictionaries in python they're extremely dictionaries in python they're extremely important and they have a lot of important and they have a lot of important and they have a lot of applications in the real world applications in the real world applications in the real world okay here's an exercise for you so here okay here's an exercise for you so here okay here's an exercise for you so here we have this program that asks our phone we have this program that asks our phone we have this program that asks our phone number let's type one two three four we number let's type one two three four we number let's type one two three four we type it in digits and then this will type it in digits and then this will type it in digits and then this will translate it to words take a look enter translate it to words take a look enter translate it to words take a look enter it prints one two three four that's a it prints one two three four that's a it prints one two three four that's a pretty cool program so go ahead and pretty cool program so go ahead and pretty cool program so go ahead and spend a few minutes on this exercise spend a few minutes on this exercise spend a few minutes on this exercise it's pretty easy i'll see you next all right so first we need to get the all right so first we need to get the all right so first we need to get the user's phone number we call the input user's phone number we call the input user's phone number we call the input function function function with the label phone we get the result with the label phone we get the result with the label phone we get the result and store it and store it and store it in this variable in this variable in this variable now let's say the user enters one two now let's say the user enters one two now let's say the user enters one two three four so we need to loop through three four so we need to loop through three four so we need to loop through this string get each character and this string get each character and this string get each character and translate it to a word translate it to a word translate it to a word so what we need to implement this so what we need to implement this so what we need to implement this scenario is a dictionary because a scenario is a dictionary because a scenario is a dictionary because a dictionary is a structure that allows us dictionary is a structure that allows us dictionary is a structure that allows us to map a key to a value so we can have a to map a key to a value so we can have a to map a key to a value so we can have a dictionary with keys like one two three dictionary with keys like one two three dictionary with keys like one two three four and we map each of these keys four and we map each of these keys four and we map each of these keys to a word so we can map the digit one to to a word so we can map the digit one to to a word so we can map the digit one to the word the word the word one we can map two one we can map two one we can map two to two you got the point so let's define to two you got the point so let's define to two you got the point so let's define a dictionary we can call it digits a dictionary we can call it digits a dictionary we can call it digits underline mapping underline mapping underline mapping now this dictionary i'm gonna add a few now this dictionary i'm gonna add a few now this dictionary i'm gonna add a few key value pairs key value pairs key value pairs one we map it to one one we map it to one one we map it to one two two two to two to two to two three to three and finally three to three and finally three to three and finally four to four now technically we should four to four now technically we should four to four now technically we should add all the digits from zero to nine but add all the digits from zero to nine but add all the digits from zero to nine but i don't wanna waste your time typing i don't wanna waste your time typing i don't wanna waste your time typing repetitive things here you got the point repetitive things here you got the point repetitive things here you got the point so let's move on now we need to loop so let's move on now we need to loop so let's move on now we need to loop through the phone string so through the phone string so through the phone string so for for for character character character in phone in phone in phone we get each character and then use it to we get each character and then use it to we get each character and then use it to access a key value pair in our access a key value pair in our access a key value pair in our dictionary so dictionary so dictionary so digits underline mapping digits underline mapping digits underline mapping we can use square brackets or call the we can use square brackets or call the we can use square brackets or call the get method i would prefer to use the get get method i would prefer to use the get get method i would prefer to use the get method so in case the user enters some method so in case the user enters some method so in case the user enters some character that is not part of our character that is not part of our character that is not part of our dictionary our program is not going to dictionary our program is not going to dictionary our program is not going to yell at them yell at them yell at them so so so we call the get method we call the get method we call the get method and pass this character as the key and pass this character as the key and pass this character as the key and if we don't have this key we can and if we don't have this key we can and if we don't have this key we can supply supply supply a default value like an exclamation mark a default value like an exclamation mark a default value like an exclamation mark so with this we'll get a word now we so with this we'll get a word now we so with this we'll get a word now we need to add this word to an output need to add this word to an output need to add this word to an output string so we can define an output string string so we can define an output string string so we can define an output string initially we set it to an empty string initially we set it to an empty string initially we set it to an empty string in each iteration we get this and add it in each iteration we get this and add it in each iteration we get this and add it to our output string so we type output to our output string so we type output to our output string so we type output plus equals plus equals plus equals this this this and we should also add a space at the and we should also add a space at the and we should also add a space at the end end end so the words are not close to each other so the words are not close to each other so the words are not close to each other okay okay okay that's all we have to do that's all we have to do that's all we have to do now finally let's print this output now finally let's print this output now finally let's print this output run our program so i'm going to type one run our program so i'm going to type one run our program so i'm going to type one three four three four three four five let's see what we get we get one five let's see what we get we get one five let's see what we get we get one three four with an exclamation mark in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you something really cool that you can do something really cool that you can do something really cool that you can do with dictionaries so here we have this with dictionaries so here we have this with dictionaries so here we have this program we can type a message like good program we can type a message like good program we can type a message like good morning morning morning followed by a smiley face when we press followed by a smiley face when we press followed by a smiley face when we press enter we get this beautiful smiley face enter we get this beautiful smiley face enter we get this beautiful smiley face or or or we can type we can type we can type i am sad with the sad smiley face and it i am sad with the sad smiley face and it i am sad with the sad smiley face and it gets translated to this beautiful emoji gets translated to this beautiful emoji gets translated to this beautiful emoji so this is another application of using so this is another application of using so this is another application of using dictionaries we have a dictionary that dictionaries we have a dictionary that dictionaries we have a dictionary that maps these characters into smiley faces maps these characters into smiley faces maps these characters into smiley faces so let's go ahead and build this program so let's go ahead and build this program so let's go ahead and build this program together together together we start by calling the input function we start by calling the input function we start by calling the input function here we pass a greater than symbol as an here we pass a greater than symbol as an here we pass a greater than symbol as an indicator for the user to type a message indicator for the user to type a message indicator for the user to type a message we get that message store it here we get that message store it here we get that message store it here as you know that is a string now we need as you know that is a string now we need as you know that is a string now we need to split the string by a space to split the string by a space to split the string by a space so if the user types good morning with a so if the user types good morning with a so if the user types good morning with a smiley face we want to break this down smiley face we want to break this down smiley face we want to break this down into three words good into three words good into three words good morning morning morning and smiley face and smiley face and smiley face to do that we can call the split method to do that we can call the split method to do that we can call the split method so so so we call message dot split we call message dot split we call message dot split and pass and pass and pass a string with one space as the separator a string with one space as the separator a string with one space as the separator what this method does is basically it what this method does is basically it what this method does is basically it goes through the string and anywhere it goes through the string and anywhere it goes through the string and anywhere it finds this character in this case a finds this character in this case a finds this character in this case a space it uses that as a boundary to space it uses that as a boundary to space it uses that as a boundary to separate this string into multiple words separate this string into multiple words separate this string into multiple words and then it will return a list let me and then it will return a list let me and then it will return a list let me show you so let's store that here words show you so let's store that here words show you so let's store that here words and then print it and then print it and then print it on the terminal on the terminal on the terminal let's go ahead and run our program so if let's go ahead and run our program so if let's go ahead and run our program so if we type good morning sunshine enter we we type good morning sunshine enter we we type good morning sunshine enter we get a list with three items each item is get a list with three items each item is get a list with three items each item is a string okay a string okay a string okay now now now back to our program we need to define a back to our program we need to define a back to our program we need to define a dictionary for mapping special dictionary for mapping special dictionary for mapping special characters like these two into a smiley characters like these two into a smiley characters like these two into a smiley face face face so so so we can call that emojis we can call that emojis we can call that emojis set it to curly braces here we add a key set it to curly braces here we add a key set it to curly braces here we add a key value pair value pair value pair a smiley face and we map that to a smiley face and we map that to a smiley face and we map that to a string in the string we want to add an a string in the string we want to add an a string in the string we want to add an emoji emoji emoji if you're on a mac keyboard you can if you're on a mac keyboard you can if you're on a mac keyboard you can press ctrl press ctrl press ctrl command and space and this should bring command and space and this should bring command and space and this should bring up this emoji box if you're on windows up this emoji box if you're on windows up this emoji box if you're on windows honestly i really don't know how you can honestly i really don't know how you can honestly i really don't know how you can do this but there must be applications do this but there must be applications do this but there must be applications that do this for you so let's go ahead that do this for you so let's go ahead that do this for you so let's go ahead and pick this and pick this and pick this happy smiley face good now let's add happy smiley face good now let's add happy smiley face good now let's add another key value pair for a sad face another key value pair for a sad face another key value pair for a sad face we map this to we map this to we map this to this this this face here face here face here good good good so we have a list of words now we need so we have a list of words now we need so we have a list of words now we need to loop through this list get each word to loop through this list get each word to loop through this list get each word and potentially map it to an emoji so we and potentially map it to an emoji so we and potentially map it to an emoji so we can write a for loop for word in words can write a for loop for word in words can write a for loop for word in words now we want to go to our dictionary and now we want to go to our dictionary and now we want to go to our dictionary and see if you have an item with this word see if you have an item with this word see if you have an item with this word as the key as the key as the key if you have an item with that key then if you have an item with that key then if you have an item with that key then we'll get its value otherwise we want to we'll get its value otherwise we want to we'll get its value otherwise we want to use the same word so if the user types use the same word so if the user types use the same word so if the user types good morning we don't want to translate good morning we don't want to translate good morning we don't want to translate those words we just want to return those those words we just want to return those those words we just want to return those so that is the case where we use the get so that is the case where we use the get so that is the case where we use the get method to supply a default value so we method to supply a default value so we method to supply a default value so we want to get an item with the key want to get an item with the key want to get an item with the key word and if we don't have an item with word and if we don't have an item with word and if we don't have an item with that key we simply use that word as the that key we simply use that word as the that key we simply use that word as the default value now similar to the default value now similar to the default value now similar to the exercise that we did in the last exercise that we did in the last exercise that we did in the last tutorial we need an output variable so tutorial we need an output variable so tutorial we need an output variable so let's define that here output set it to let's define that here output set it to let's define that here output set it to an empty string an empty string an empty string now back to line 9 now back to line 9 now back to line 9 we get the return value of the get we get the return value of the get we get the return value of the get method and add it to our output variable method and add it to our output variable method and add it to our output variable so output so output so output plus equals whatever we get from the get plus equals whatever we get from the get plus equals whatever we get from the get method and finally we need to append a method and finally we need to append a method and finally we need to append a space at the end space at the end space at the end that's it we're done so let's print the that's it we're done so let's print the that's it we're done so let's print the output output output and run our program and run our program and run our program i'm gonna type good morning sunshine i'm gonna type good morning sunshine i'm gonna type good morning sunshine with a smiley face with a smiley face with a smiley face we get that beautiful let's try a sad we get that beautiful let's try a sad we get that beautiful let's try a sad face as well i am sad face as well i am sad face as well i am sad too bad too bad too bad beautiful so as you can see dictionaries beautiful so as you can see dictionaries beautiful so as you can see dictionaries have a lot of use cases in real have a lot of use cases in real have a lot of use cases in real applications here's the solution from the last here's the solution from the last here's the solution from the last tutorial where we created an emoji tutorial where we created an emoji tutorial where we created an emoji converter now so far we've been writing converter now so far we've been writing converter now so far we've been writing all our code right here in app.pi but as all our code right here in app.pi but as all our code right here in app.pi but as our programs grow we need a better way our programs grow we need a better way our programs grow we need a better way to organize our code we need to break up to organize our code we need to break up to organize our code we need to break up our code into smaller more manageable our code into smaller more manageable our code into smaller more manageable and more maintainable chunks which we and more maintainable chunks which we and more maintainable chunks which we call functions call functions call functions so a function is a container for a few so a function is a container for a few so a function is a container for a few lines of code that perform a specific lines of code that perform a specific lines of code that perform a specific task for example you have learned about task for example you have learned about task for example you have learned about if you have the built-in functions in if you have the built-in functions in if you have the built-in functions in python like print and python like print and python like print and input each of these functions have a input each of these functions have a input each of these functions have a purpose they know how to perform a purpose they know how to perform a purpose they know how to perform a specific task specific task specific task so when building large complex programs so when building large complex programs so when building large complex programs we should break up our code into smaller we should break up our code into smaller we should break up our code into smaller reusable chunks which we call functions reusable chunks which we call functions reusable chunks which we call functions to better organize our code and that's to better organize our code and that's to better organize our code and that's what i'm going to show you in this what i'm going to show you in this what i'm going to show you in this tutorial so let's write a simple program tutorial so let's write a simple program tutorial so let's write a simple program for printing a greeting message so we're for printing a greeting message so we're for printing a greeting message so we're going to do a print going to do a print going to do a print hi there hi there hi there and let's add another message welcome and let's add another message welcome and let's add another message welcome aboard aboard aboard so here we have a simple program with so here we have a simple program with so here we have a simple program with only two lines of code now let's say only two lines of code now let's say only two lines of code now let's say these two lines potentially we're going these two lines potentially we're going these two lines potentially we're going to need them in other programs so we can to need them in other programs so we can to need them in other programs so we can put them in a function that we can reuse put them in a function that we can reuse put them in a function that we can reuse let me show you how to do that so let me show you how to do that so let me show you how to do that so we start we start we start typing out def that is a reserved typing out def that is a reserved typing out def that is a reserved keyword in python and it's short for keyword in python and it's short for keyword in python and it's short for define when python interpreter sees this define when python interpreter sees this define when python interpreter sees this it knows that we're defining a function it knows that we're defining a function it knows that we're defining a function next we need to give our function a name next we need to give our function a name next we need to give our function a name let's say greet let's say greet let's say greet underline underline underline user so all the best practices you learn user so all the best practices you learn user so all the best practices you learn about naming your variables also apply about naming your variables also apply about naming your variables also apply here which means you should name your here which means you should name your here which means you should name your functions with lowercase characters if functions with lowercase characters if functions with lowercase characters if there are multiple words you need to there are multiple words you need to there are multiple words you need to separate them using an underscore and separate them using an underscore and separate them using an underscore and you should always always always always you should always always always always you should always always always always use meaningful and descriptive names for use meaningful and descriptive names for use meaningful and descriptive names for your functions your functions your functions so here we're defining a function called so here we're defining a function called so here we're defining a function called createuser after that we need to add createuser after that we need to add createuser after that we need to add parentheses followed by a colon now you parentheses followed by a colon now you parentheses followed by a colon now you know that whenever we add a colon at the know that whenever we add a colon at the know that whenever we add a colon at the end of a line we're telling python that end of a line we're telling python that end of a line we're telling python that we're defining a block of code so when we're defining a block of code so when we're defining a block of code so when we press enter the next line is indented we press enter the next line is indented we press enter the next line is indented now any code that'd be right here will now any code that'd be right here will now any code that'd be right here will belong to this function belong to this function belong to this function so so so i'm going to move these two lines these i'm going to move these two lines these i'm going to move these two lines these two print statements inside of our two print statements inside of our two print statements inside of our function we can simply press tab to function we can simply press tab to function we can simply press tab to indent them beautiful also let's remove indent them beautiful also let's remove indent them beautiful also let's remove this extra line break that is better so this extra line break that is better so this extra line break that is better so these two lines these two lines these two lines now are part of our greet user function now are part of our greet user function now are part of our greet user function so whenever we call this function these so whenever we call this function these so whenever we call this function these two lines will be executed okay now two lines will be executed okay now two lines will be executed okay now let's remove indentation so here we are let's remove indentation so here we are let's remove indentation so here we are outside of our function outside of our function outside of our function let's do a print statement let's do a print statement let's do a print statement and print start and print start and print start after that let's call our function so after that let's call our function so after that let's call our function so greet user greet user greet user and finally let's do another print and finally let's do another print and finally let's do another print statement statement statement and print finish and print finish and print finish now we have this little warning here now we have this little warning here now we have this little warning here this underline this underline this underline if you hover your mouse over this line if you hover your mouse over this line if you hover your mouse over this line this tooltip is telling you that we this tooltip is telling you that we this tooltip is telling you that we should add two blank lines after should add two blank lines after should add two blank lines after function definition this is coming from function definition this is coming from function definition this is coming from pep8 which is a document that defines pep8 which is a document that defines pep8 which is a document that defines the best practices for formatting our the best practices for formatting our the best practices for formatting our code we'll look at that in the future so code we'll look at that in the future so code we'll look at that in the future so for now to make pycharm happy let's add for now to make pycharm happy let's add for now to make pycharm happy let's add an extra line break after this function an extra line break after this function an extra line break after this function so whenever we define a function we need so whenever we define a function we need so whenever we define a function we need to add two line breaks after okay to add two line breaks after okay to add two line breaks after okay so so so now let's run our program and see what now let's run our program and see what now let's run our program and see what happens all right so we get four happens all right so we get four happens all right so we get four messages on the terminal first we get messages on the terminal first we get messages on the terminal first we get the start message then we get the the start message then we get the the start message then we get the messages coming from our create function messages coming from our create function messages coming from our create function so hi there and welcome aboard and so hi there and welcome aboard and so hi there and welcome aboard and finally we see the finished message finally we see the finished message finally we see the finished message so let me explain the flow of our so let me explain the flow of our so let me explain the flow of our program when python runs this code it program when python runs this code it program when python runs this code it doesn't actually print these two doesn't actually print these two doesn't actually print these two messages on the terminal because these messages on the terminal because these messages on the terminal because these lines of code are inside of this lines of code are inside of this lines of code are inside of this function so they will only get executed function so they will only get executed function so they will only get executed if we call this function if we don't if we call this function if we don't if we call this function if we don't call this function these lines will not call this function these lines will not call this function these lines will not get executed okay get executed okay get executed okay so the execution of our program actually so the execution of our program actually so the execution of our program actually starts here the first message that we starts here the first message that we starts here the first message that we see on the terminal is the start message see on the terminal is the start message see on the terminal is the start message after that python sees that we're after that python sees that we're after that python sees that we're calling the greet function so it will calling the greet function so it will calling the greet function so it will jump over here and then execute these jump over here and then execute these jump over here and then execute these two lines two lines two lines then it will jump outside of this then it will jump outside of this then it will jump outside of this function and continue the normal function and continue the normal function and continue the normal execution of our program so it will execution of our program so it will execution of our program so it will print the finished message on the print the finished message on the print the finished message on the terminal terminal terminal so this is how functions work so this is how functions work so this is how functions work also note that the order of this code also note that the order of this code also note that the order of this code matters so here we're calling the grid matters so here we're calling the grid matters so here we're calling the grid function after we have defined it if you function after we have defined it if you function after we have defined it if you try to call it before you define it you try to call it before you define it you try to call it before you define it you will see an error for example will see an error for example will see an error for example if we call if we call if we call greet user function right here see we greet user function right here see we greet user function right here see we immediately get this red underline which immediately get this red underline which immediately get this red underline which says unresolved reference greet user says unresolved reference greet user says unresolved reference greet user which basically means python doesn't which basically means python doesn't which basically means python doesn't know what is this great user it's not know what is this great user it's not know what is this great user it's not defined anywhere defined anywhere defined anywhere so we always define our functions first so we always define our functions first so we always define our functions first and then call that here's the function we created in the here's the function we created in the here's the function we created in the last tutorial now i got a question for last tutorial now i got a question for last tutorial now i got a question for you what is the difference between you what is the difference between you what is the difference between calling this function calling this function calling this function and the print function of python and the print function of python and the print function of python the difference is that the print the difference is that the print the difference is that the print function takes some information in this function takes some information in this function takes some information in this case the message that we want to print case the message that we want to print case the message that we want to print but our grid function doesn't take any but our grid function doesn't take any but our grid function doesn't take any information wouldn't that be nicer if information wouldn't that be nicer if information wouldn't that be nicer if you could pass the name of the user here you could pass the name of the user here you could pass the name of the user here and then instead of saying hi there we and then instead of saying hi there we and then instead of saying hi there we could print the name of the user so in could print the name of the user so in could print the name of the user so in this tutorial i'm going to show you how this tutorial i'm going to show you how this tutorial i'm going to show you how to pass information to your functions to pass information to your functions to pass information to your functions and that is pretty easy and that is pretty easy and that is pretty easy so so so back to the definition of our great user back to the definition of our great user back to the definition of our great user function function function inside of this parenthesis we can add inside of this parenthesis we can add inside of this parenthesis we can add parameters these parameters are parameters these parameters are parameters these parameters are placeholders for receiving information placeholders for receiving information placeholders for receiving information for example we can add a name parameter for example we can add a name parameter for example we can add a name parameter and with this we can pass the name of and with this we can pass the name of and with this we can pass the name of the user when calling this function so the user when calling this function so the user when calling this function so let's pass john here let's pass john here let's pass john here now when we call this function and pass now when we call this function and pass now when we call this function and pass this value this name parameter will be this value this name parameter will be this value this name parameter will be set to john set to john set to john so it will act like a local variable so it will act like a local variable so it will act like a local variable that we define inside of this function that we define inside of this function that we define inside of this function just imagine we didn't have this just imagine we didn't have this just imagine we didn't have this parameter and instead we had a variable parameter and instead we had a variable parameter and instead we had a variable like name that was set to john now here like name that was set to john now here like name that was set to john now here we could simply print the name of this we could simply print the name of this we could simply print the name of this user so we could use a formatted string user so we could use a formatted string user so we could use a formatted string and print the value of the name variable and print the value of the name variable and print the value of the name variable right now we don't really have this right now we don't really have this right now we don't really have this local variable defined in this function local variable defined in this function local variable defined in this function we have a parameter we have a parameter we have a parameter it's exactly the same thing so with it's exactly the same thing so with it's exactly the same thing so with these parameters we can receive these parameters we can receive these parameters we can receive information in our functions now let's information in our functions now let's information in our functions now let's go ahead and run this program so take a look we get hi john welcome so take a look we get hi john welcome so take a look we get hi john welcome aboard we can take this to the next aboard we can take this to the next aboard we can take this to the next level now we can call this function one level now we can call this function one level now we can call this function one more time more time more time so greet user and this time supply a so greet user and this time supply a so greet user and this time supply a different name let's say mary different name let's say mary different name let's say mary so we are reusing our grid function and so we are reusing our grid function and so we are reusing our grid function and passing it a different value passing it a different value passing it a different value imagine if we didn't have this function imagine if we didn't have this function imagine if we didn't have this function we would have to repeat this line twice we would have to repeat this line twice we would have to repeat this line twice once for high john and another time for once for high john and another time for once for high john and another time for hi mary so this is the benefit of hi mary so this is the benefit of hi mary so this is the benefit of defining functions we can take a few defining functions we can take a few defining functions we can take a few lines of code that have a specific lines of code that have a specific lines of code that have a specific purpose and put them inside of a purpose and put them inside of a purpose and put them inside of a function function function so now let's run our program one more so now let's run our program one more so now let's run our program one more time time time there you go so we get hi john welcome there you go so we get hi john welcome there you go so we get hi john welcome board then we get high mary welcome board then we get high mary welcome board then we get high mary welcome aboard aboard aboard now note that when a function has a now note that when a function has a now note that when a function has a parameter we are obligated to pass a parameter we are obligated to pass a parameter we are obligated to pass a value for that parameter so if we remove value for that parameter so if we remove value for that parameter so if we remove john john john from here from here from here and run our program we get this type and run our program we get this type and run our program we get this type error grid user missing one required error grid user missing one required error grid user missing one required positional argument positional argument positional argument argument in programming is the value argument in programming is the value argument in programming is the value that we supply to a function so that we supply to a function so that we supply to a function so back to this example back to this example back to this example mary in this case is an argument that we mary in this case is an argument that we mary in this case is an argument that we pass to the name parameter a lot of pass to the name parameter a lot of pass to the name parameter a lot of programmers don't know the difference programmers don't know the difference programmers don't know the difference between parameters and arguments and between parameters and arguments and between parameters and arguments and think they are the same but they are not think they are the same but they are not think they are the same but they are not parameters or the holes or placeholders parameters or the holes or placeholders parameters or the holes or placeholders that we define in our function for that we define in our function for that we define in our function for receiving information receiving information receiving information arguments are the actual pieces of arguments are the actual pieces of arguments are the actual pieces of information that we supply to these information that we supply to these information that we supply to these functions okay functions okay functions okay so let's bring back so let's bring back so let's bring back this john string okay now we can also this john string okay now we can also this john string okay now we can also define multiple parameters for example define multiple parameters for example define multiple parameters for example let's rename this parameter to first let's rename this parameter to first let's rename this parameter to first name as i told you before you can right name as i told you before you can right name as i told you before you can right click here go to refactor and then click here go to refactor and then click here go to refactor and then rename or preferably you can use a rename or preferably you can use a rename or preferably you can use a shortcut so the shortcut for this on mac shortcut so the shortcut for this on mac shortcut so the shortcut for this on mac is shift and f6 is shift and f6 is shift and f6 and this brings up the rename dialog box and this brings up the rename dialog box and this brings up the rename dialog box here we can change this to first here we can change this to first here we can change this to first underline name underline name underline name now we can add a second parameter so now we can add a second parameter so now we can add a second parameter so comma comma comma followed by last underline name followed by last underline name followed by last underline name so back to our formatted string let's so back to our formatted string let's so back to our formatted string let's also print the last name beautiful so also print the last name beautiful so also print the last name beautiful so here when calling this function then we here when calling this function then we here when calling this function then we can supply can supply can supply another argument another argument another argument so john smith and let's delete so john smith and let's delete so john smith and let's delete this line we don't really need it this line we don't really need it this line we don't really need it anymore run our program take a look hi anymore run our program take a look hi anymore run our program take a look hi john smith so in the last tutorial you'll learn so in the last tutorial you'll learn so in the last tutorial you'll learn that whenever we define parameters for that whenever we define parameters for that whenever we define parameters for our functions we should always supply our functions we should always supply our functions we should always supply values otherwise we'll get an error values otherwise we'll get an error values otherwise we'll get an error let's look at that there one more time let's look at that there one more time let's look at that there one more time so i'm going to delete the second so i'm going to delete the second so i'm going to delete the second argument and only pass john argument and only pass john argument and only pass john run our program run our program run our program we get this message we get this message we get this message greet user missing one required greet user missing one required greet user missing one required positional argument positional argument positional argument so these are arguments that we have here so these are arguments that we have here so these are arguments that we have here like john and smith we refer to these as like john and smith we refer to these as like john and smith we refer to these as positional arguments which means their positional arguments which means their positional arguments which means their position or order matters in other words position or order matters in other words position or order matters in other words the first argument we add here is the the first argument we add here is the the first argument we add here is the value for the first parameter and the value for the first parameter and the value for the first parameter and the second argument is the value for the second argument is the value for the second argument is the value for the second parameter so if we change their second parameter so if we change their second parameter so if we change their position or order we'll get different position or order we'll get different position or order we'll get different result let's take a look let's pass result let's take a look let's pass result let's take a look let's pass smith first and then smith first and then smith first and then john okay john okay john okay delete that's good let's go with this delete that's good let's go with this delete that's good let's go with this so instead of getting high john smith we so instead of getting high john smith we so instead of getting high john smith we get high smith john get high smith john get high smith john so that is the reason we refer to these so that is the reason we refer to these so that is the reason we refer to these arguments as positional arguments their arguments as positional arguments their arguments as positional arguments their position or order matters but in python position or order matters but in python position or order matters but in python we also have keyword arguments and with we also have keyword arguments and with we also have keyword arguments and with those the position doesn't matter let me those the position doesn't matter let me those the position doesn't matter let me show you how they work so let's say here show you how they work so let's say here show you how they work so let's say here we want to pass john as the value for we want to pass john as the value for we want to pass john as the value for the first name parameter we can simply the first name parameter we can simply the first name parameter we can simply specify that here so first name equals specify that here so first name equals specify that here so first name equals john john john now what we have here is a keyword now what we have here is a keyword now what we have here is a keyword argument argument argument so this combination of having the so this combination of having the so this combination of having the parameter name followed by its value is parameter name followed by its value is parameter name followed by its value is what we call a keyword argument and with what we call a keyword argument and with what we call a keyword argument and with these keyword arguments the position these keyword arguments the position these keyword arguments the position doesn't really matter doesn't really matter doesn't really matter so here we're supplying john as an so here we're supplying john as an so here we're supplying john as an argument for the first parameter argument for the first parameter argument for the first parameter now similarly we can use a keyword now similarly we can use a keyword now similarly we can use a keyword argument for smith let me show you so argument for smith let me show you so argument for smith let me show you so last name equals smith's last name equals smith's last name equals smith's so now we have two keyword arguments so so now we have two keyword arguments so so now we have two keyword arguments so with these keyword arguments we don't with these keyword arguments we don't with these keyword arguments we don't have to worry about the order of the have to worry about the order of the have to worry about the order of the parameters that doesn't mean we should parameters that doesn't mean we should parameters that doesn't mean we should always use keyword arguments not really always use keyword arguments not really always use keyword arguments not really most of the time we use positional most of the time we use positional most of the time we use positional arguments but in certain situations arguments but in certain situations arguments but in certain situations these keyword arguments help us improve these keyword arguments help us improve these keyword arguments help us improve the readability of our code the readability of our code the readability of our code so on line 7 it's quite clear that we're so on line 7 it's quite clear that we're so on line 7 it's quite clear that we're supplying smith as the last name and supplying smith as the last name and supplying smith as the last name and john as the first name john as the first name john as the first name now in this particular example even if now in this particular example even if now in this particular example even if we didn't have the keyword arguments we didn't have the keyword arguments we didn't have the keyword arguments just passing two positional arguments just passing two positional arguments just passing two positional arguments like john and smith would be sufficient like john and smith would be sufficient like john and smith would be sufficient because it's easy to guess what is the because it's easy to guess what is the because it's easy to guess what is the purpose of this argument but sometimes purpose of this argument but sometimes purpose of this argument but sometimes you're dealing with functions and you're you're dealing with functions and you're you're dealing with functions and you're passing numerical values to them in passing numerical values to them in passing numerical values to them in those situations it may not be quite those situations it may not be quite those situations it may not be quite clear what these values represent let me clear what these values represent let me clear what these values represent let me show you an example let's say we have a show you an example let's say we have a show you an example let's say we have a function for calculating the total cost function for calculating the total cost function for calculating the total cost of an order so we can call that of an order so we can call that of an order so we can call that calculate underlink cost calculate underlink cost calculate underlink cost so when calling this function we need to so when calling this function we need to so when calling this function we need to supply three pieces of information supply three pieces of information supply three pieces of information one is the total cost of all the order one is the total cost of all the order one is the total cost of all the order items let's say fifty dollars items let's say fifty dollars items let's say fifty dollars the other is the shipping cost let's say the other is the shipping cost let's say the other is the shipping cost let's say five dollars and the last piece is a five dollars and the last piece is a five dollars and the last piece is a discount let's say 0.1 discount let's say 0.1 discount let's say 0.1 someone reading this code may not be someone reading this code may not be someone reading this code may not be sure what these three values represent sure what these three values represent sure what these three values represent in this case we can improve the in this case we can improve the in this case we can improve the readability of this code by using readability of this code by using readability of this code by using keyword arguments so we can prefix each keyword arguments so we can prefix each keyword arguments so we can prefix each value with the name of the parameter value with the name of the parameter value with the name of the parameter they target for example we can set total they target for example we can set total they target for example we can set total to 50 and then shipping to 5 and to 50 and then shipping to 5 and to 50 and then shipping to 5 and discount to 0.1 discount to 0.1 discount to 0.1 now if we give this code to someone else now if we give this code to someone else now if we give this code to someone else they can immediately tell what these they can immediately tell what these they can immediately tell what these values represent so that is the power of values represent so that is the power of values represent so that is the power of keyword arguments so here's what i want keyword arguments so here's what i want keyword arguments so here's what i want you to take away for the most part use you to take away for the most part use you to take away for the most part use positional arguments but if you're positional arguments but if you're positional arguments but if you're dealing with functions that take dealing with functions that take dealing with functions that take numerical values see if you can improve numerical values see if you can improve numerical values see if you can improve the readability of your code by using the readability of your code by using the readability of your code by using keyword arguments you simply prefix the keyword arguments you simply prefix the keyword arguments you simply prefix the arguments that you pass with the name of arguments that you pass with the name of arguments that you pass with the name of their parameters and this will increase their parameters and this will increase their parameters and this will increase the readability of your code now there the readability of your code now there the readability of your code now there is one more thing you need to know about is one more thing you need to know about is one more thing you need to know about keyword arguments these keyword keyword arguments these keyword keyword arguments these keyword arguments should always come after arguments should always come after arguments should always come after positional arguments let me show you positional arguments let me show you positional arguments let me show you what i mean so what i mean so what i mean so back to our simple create user function back to our simple create user function back to our simple create user function let's use a keyword argument for the let's use a keyword argument for the let's use a keyword argument for the first name first name first name so so so let's set first name to john and see let's set first name to john and see let's set first name to john and see what happens look we immediately get what happens look we immediately get what happens look we immediately get this error take a look positional this error take a look positional this error take a look positional argument after keyword argument so when argument after keyword argument so when argument after keyword argument so when calling this function we're supplying calling this function we're supplying calling this function we're supplying one keyword argument and one positional one keyword argument and one positional one keyword argument and one positional argument and python doesn't like this argument and python doesn't like this argument and python doesn't like this so if you're mixing positional and so if you're mixing positional and so if you're mixing positional and keyword arguments you should always use keyword arguments you should always use keyword arguments you should always use the positional arguments first and then the positional arguments first and then the positional arguments first and then the keyboard arguments the keyboard arguments the keyboard arguments in other words let's remove this keyword in other words let's remove this keyword in other words let's remove this keyword argument here argument here argument here so john is now a positional argument is so john is now a positional argument is so john is now a positional argument is targeting the first parameter right now targeting the first parameter right now targeting the first parameter right now after this position argument we can after this position argument we can after this position argument we can supply any number of keyword arguments supply any number of keyword arguments supply any number of keyword arguments so if we set last name to smith look so if we set last name to smith look so if we set last name to smith look python doesn't have any problem with python doesn't have any problem with python doesn't have any problem with this because we're adding a keyword this because we're adding a keyword this because we're adding a keyword argument after a positional argument so argument after a positional argument so argument after a positional argument so let's quickly recap for the most part let's quickly recap for the most part let's quickly recap for the most part use positional arguments if you're use positional arguments if you're use positional arguments if you're dealing with functions that take dealing with functions that take dealing with functions that take multiple numerical values and it's not multiple numerical values and it's not multiple numerical values and it's not quite clear what those values represent quite clear what those values represent quite clear what those values represent use keyword arguments to improve the use keyword arguments to improve the use keyword arguments to improve the readability of your code and finally if readability of your code and finally if readability of your code and finally if you're passing both positional and you're passing both positional and you're passing both positional and keyboard arguments use the keyword keyboard arguments use the keyword keyboard arguments use the keyword arguments after the positional arguments so far you have learned how to create so far you have learned how to create so far you have learned how to create functions and send them information functions and send them information functions and send them information using their parameters using their parameters using their parameters in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to create functions that return how to create functions that return how to create functions that return values this is particularly useful if values this is particularly useful if values this is particularly useful if you're doing some kind of calculation you're doing some kind of calculation you're doing some kind of calculation your function and you want to return the your function and you want to return the your function and you want to return the result to whoever is using your function result to whoever is using your function result to whoever is using your function let me show you so let me show you so let me show you so let's start by defining a function let's start by defining a function let's start by defining a function called square this function simply called square this function simply called square this function simply calculates the square of a number calculates the square of a number calculates the square of a number so we need to add one parameter here so we need to add one parameter here so we need to add one parameter here that is our number that is our number that is our number now here we want to calculate number now here we want to calculate number now here we want to calculate number times number that is the square of a times number that is the square of a times number that is the square of a number number number now to return this number outside of now to return this number outside of now to return this number outside of this function we simply use the return this function we simply use the return this function we simply use the return statement so return statement so return statement so return now our square function is very simple now our square function is very simple now our square function is very simple it only has one line of code but in a it only has one line of code but in a it only has one line of code but in a real program you might have a function real program you might have a function real program you might have a function that has 10 lines of code to calculate that has 10 lines of code to calculate that has 10 lines of code to calculate something so something so something so this return statement is very valuable this return statement is very valuable this return statement is very valuable with that we can return values to the with that we can return values to the with that we can return values to the colors of our function colors of our function colors of our function so with this when we call so with this when we call so with this when we call the square function let's say we give it the square function let's say we give it the square function let's say we give it now this function returns a value just now this function returns a value just now this function returns a value just like the input function of python this like the input function of python this like the input function of python this input function waits for the user to input function waits for the user to input function waits for the user to type something and press enter and then type something and press enter and then type something and press enter and then it will return the user's input as a it will return the user's input as a it will return the user's input as a string so we can get it and store it string so we can get it and store it string so we can get it and store it in a variable like this right we have in a variable like this right we have in a variable like this right we have the same story with our square function the same story with our square function the same story with our square function so our square function returns a value so our square function returns a value so our square function returns a value we can simply get it and store it in a we can simply get it and store it in a we can simply get it and store it in a variable let's call that result variable let's call that result variable let's call that result now we can print now we can print now we can print result on the terminal result on the terminal result on the terminal there you go so result is nine we could there you go so result is nine we could there you go so result is nine we could also also also pass this function call directly inside pass this function call directly inside pass this function call directly inside of the print function without defining a of the print function without defining a of the print function without defining a separate variable sometimes this is separate variable sometimes this is separate variable sometimes this is useful for writing shorter code so in useful for writing shorter code so in useful for writing shorter code so in this case we don't really need this this case we don't really need this this case we don't really need this result variable we simply want to print result variable we simply want to print result variable we simply want to print the square of three the square of three the square of three so we could simply pass this function so we could simply pass this function so we could simply pass this function call call call right here as an argument for the print right here as an argument for the print right here as an argument for the print function function function so let's delete this variable now our so let's delete this variable now our so let's delete this variable now our code is shorter so with this we're code is shorter so with this we're code is shorter so with this we're calling the square function this returns calling the square function this returns calling the square function this returns a value and we'll pass that value as an a value and we'll pass that value as an a value and we'll pass that value as an argument to the print function argument to the print function argument to the print function okay okay okay when we run this program we get the when we run this program we get the when we run this program we get the exact same result there you go exact same result there you go exact same result there you go now what happens if we don't use a now what happens if we don't use a now what happens if we don't use a return statement in our function so in return statement in our function so in return statement in our function so in the last example we simply used a print the last example we simply used a print the last example we simply used a print statement let's temporarily statement let's temporarily statement let's temporarily remove this return statement and remove this return statement and remove this return statement and print the result on the terminal like print the result on the terminal like print the result on the terminal like this this this so let's run our program one more time so let's run our program one more time so let's run our program one more time and see what we get we get two things on and see what we get we get two things on and see what we get we get two things on a terminal the number nine and none what a terminal the number nine and none what a terminal the number nine and none what is happening here is happening here is happening here well when python interpreter executes well when python interpreter executes well when python interpreter executes this code first it will call the square this code first it will call the square this code first it will call the square function function function so the control moves to the square so the control moves to the square so the control moves to the square function here we calculate the square of function here we calculate the square of function here we calculate the square of this given number and then print it on this given number and then print it on this given number and then print it on the terminal that is the reason we see 9 the terminal that is the reason we see 9 the terminal that is the reason we see 9 right here right here right here now by default all functions return the now by default all functions return the now by default all functions return the value none value none value none so if we don't have a return statement so if we don't have a return statement so if we don't have a return statement here here here by default python returns by default python returns by default python returns none none is an object that represents none none is an object that represents none none is an object that represents the absence of a value it's like nothing the absence of a value it's like nothing the absence of a value it's like nothing or null in c c plus plus java and or null in c c plus plus java and or null in c c plus plus java and javascript javascript javascript so so so in this example we didn't have a return in this example we didn't have a return in this example we didn't have a return statement and by default python returned statement and by default python returned statement and by default python returned none from this function none from this function none from this function so after the square function is executed so after the square function is executed so after the square function is executed the value none is returned and passed as the value none is returned and passed as the value none is returned and passed as an argument to the print function that an argument to the print function that an argument to the print function that is the reason we see is the reason we see is the reason we see none on the second line none on the second line none on the second line so here are the two things you need to so here are the two things you need to so here are the two things you need to take away from this tutorial by default take away from this tutorial by default take away from this tutorial by default all functions in python return none you all functions in python return none you all functions in python return none you can change that so if you have a can change that so if you have a can change that so if you have a function that calculates something you function that calculates something you function that calculates something you can return the result using the return can return the result using the return can return the result using the return statement here's the code for our emoji converter here's the code for our emoji converter here's the code for our emoji converter program that we wrote earlier if you program that we wrote earlier if you program that we wrote earlier if you missed that tutorial make sure to go missed that tutorial make sure to go missed that tutorial make sure to go back and watch it as i told you before back and watch it as i told you before back and watch it as i told you before there is a table of content right below there is a table of content right below there is a table of content right below this video in the description so you can this video in the description so you can this video in the description so you can simply click on the emoji converter simply click on the emoji converter simply click on the emoji converter tutorial to watch it tutorial to watch it tutorial to watch it now your exercise is to reorganize this now your exercise is to reorganize this now your exercise is to reorganize this code using a function so i want you to code using a function so i want you to code using a function so i want you to extract a function in this code because extract a function in this code because extract a function in this code because this algorithm for converting these this algorithm for converting these this algorithm for converting these smiley faces into emojis is something smiley faces into emojis is something smiley faces into emojis is something that we probably want to use in a lot of that we probably want to use in a lot of that we probably want to use in a lot of different applications you can use it in different applications you can use it in different applications you can use it in a chat application in an email a chat application in an email a chat application in an email application and so on we don't want to application and so on we don't want to application and so on we don't want to write all this code every time we want write all this code every time we want write all this code every time we want to convert these characters into smiley to convert these characters into smiley to convert these characters into smiley faces faces faces so out of all these lines of code that so out of all these lines of code that so out of all these lines of code that we have from line 1 to line 10 the lines we have from line 1 to line 10 the lines we have from line 1 to line 10 the lines 2 to 9 belong to our algorithm 2 to 9 belong to our algorithm 2 to 9 belong to our algorithm all these lines together implement this all these lines together implement this all these lines together implement this feature feature feature so you should put these lines in a so you should put these lines in a so you should put these lines in a separate function separate function separate function now why don't we have the input in that now why don't we have the input in that now why don't we have the input in that function because the input can come in function because the input can come in function because the input can come in different forms currently we're using different forms currently we're using different forms currently we're using the input function to receive the input the input function to receive the input the input function to receive the input from the terminal but in other from the terminal but in other from the terminal but in other applications we might receive the input applications we might receive the input applications we might receive the input from a graphical user interface so the from a graphical user interface so the from a graphical user interface so the input can come in different forms we input can come in different forms we input can come in different forms we don't want to put that in our function don't want to put that in our function don't want to put that in our function because this line will not be reusable because this line will not be reusable because this line will not be reusable we want to give our function we want to give our function we want to give our function the actual message as a string we don't the actual message as a string we don't the actual message as a string we don't care how we got that message in one care how we got that message in one care how we got that message in one program we might get it from the program we might get it from the program we might get it from the terminal in another program we may get terminal in another program we may get terminal in another program we may get it from a graphical user interface it from a graphical user interface it from a graphical user interface so that is the reason this line of code so that is the reason this line of code so that is the reason this line of code should not be in that function by the should not be in that function by the should not be in that function by the same token same token same token you shouldn't include the last line in you shouldn't include the last line in you shouldn't include the last line in that function because what we do with that function because what we do with that function because what we do with the output is different from one program the output is different from one program the output is different from one program to another in this program we're to another in this program we're to another in this program we're printing the output in another program printing the output in another program printing the output in another program we might send that output as an email or we might send that output as an email or we might send that output as an email or as a response in a chat application so as a response in a chat application so as a response in a chat application so as a general rule of thumb your as a general rule of thumb your as a general rule of thumb your functions should not worry about functions should not worry about functions should not worry about receiving input and printing it these receiving input and printing it these receiving input and printing it these lines of code should not belong to your lines of code should not belong to your lines of code should not belong to your functions so go ahead and reorganize functions so go ahead and reorganize functions so go ahead and reorganize this code by extracting a function all right on the top first we need to all right on the top first we need to all right on the top first we need to define our function so we type def define our function so we type def define our function so we type def give our function a name like emoji give our function a name like emoji give our function a name like emoji underline converter so the name of this underline converter so the name of this underline converter so the name of this function clearly tells me what it does function clearly tells me what it does function clearly tells me what it does each function should be responsible for each function should be responsible for each function should be responsible for one and only one task and that task one and only one task and that task one and only one task and that task should be clearly explained in the name should be clearly explained in the name should be clearly explained in the name of the function okay of the function okay of the function okay so our emoji converter function should so our emoji converter function should so our emoji converter function should take a parameter we call that message take a parameter we call that message take a parameter we call that message that is a string right that is a string right that is a string right colon colon colon now we need to move the lines five now we need to move the lines five now we need to move the lines five all the way all the way all the way to the end of our four block to the end of our four block to the end of our four block into that function so into that function so into that function so let's select all these lines let's select all these lines let's select all these lines we can cut them from here by pressing we can cut them from here by pressing we can cut them from here by pressing command and x on mac or control and x on command and x on mac or control and x on command and x on mac or control and x on windows windows windows then we paste them here then we paste them here then we paste them here as you can see these lines are as you can see these lines are as you can see these lines are automatically indented so they are part automatically indented so they are part automatically indented so they are part of the emoji converter function if this of the emoji converter function if this of the emoji converter function if this didn't happen on your computer make sure didn't happen on your computer make sure didn't happen on your computer make sure to select these lines and use the tab to to select these lines and use the tab to to select these lines and use the tab to indent them indent them indent them all right so here's our emoji converter all right so here's our emoji converter all right so here's our emoji converter function beautiful function beautiful function beautiful now now now after that after that after that in the main flow of our program first we in the main flow of our program first we in the main flow of our program first we get the input from the user get the input from the user get the input from the user we store it in this variable message we store it in this variable message we store it in this variable message and then and then and then we call we call we call emoji converter and pass this message emoji converter and pass this message emoji converter and pass this message this function should return a value that this function should return a value that this function should return a value that is what we calculate is what we calculate is what we calculate at the end of this function so right at the end of this function so right at the end of this function so right after this 4 block we need to add a after this 4 block we need to add a after this 4 block we need to add a return statement return output return statement return output return statement return output now that our function returns a value now that our function returns a value now that our function returns a value we can get it and store it in a separate we can get it and store it in a separate we can get it and store it in a separate variable let's call that result and then variable let's call that result and then variable let's call that result and then we can simply print that here we can simply print that here we can simply print that here or we can make this code shorter we or we can make this code shorter we or we can make this code shorter we don't really need this variable here so don't really need this variable here so don't really need this variable here so we can simply we can simply we can simply call the emoji converter call the emoji converter call the emoji converter and print the result and print the result and print the result like this now here we have another line like this now here we have another line like this now here we have another line because because because as i told you before we need two blank as i told you before we need two blank as i told you before we need two blank lines after our function definitions so lines after our function definitions so lines after our function definitions so currently we have only one black line we currently we have only one black line we currently we have only one black line we need to add need to add need to add another black line another black line another black line let's go ahead and run this program to let's go ahead and run this program to let's go ahead and run this program to make sure everything works as before make sure everything works as before make sure everything works as before so i'm going to type a message like good so i'm going to type a message like good so i'm going to type a message like good morning with a smiley face morning with a smiley face morning with a smiley face good let's run it one more time good let's run it one more time good let's run it one more time i'm sad too bad okay beautiful i'm sad too bad okay beautiful i'm sad too bad okay beautiful so here's the final so here's the final so here's the final result we defined this function called result we defined this function called result we defined this function called emoji converter this function takes a emoji converter this function takes a emoji converter this function takes a parameter called message parameter called message parameter called message and finally returns the output in this tutorial i'm going to teach you in this tutorial i'm going to teach you in this tutorial i'm going to teach you guys how to handle errors in your python guys how to handle errors in your python guys how to handle errors in your python programs so let's start by writing a programs so let's start by writing a programs so let's start by writing a small program to get the user's age from small program to get the user's age from small program to get the user's age from the terminal so we call the input the terminal so we call the input the terminal so we call the input function function function input input input add a label here add a label here add a label here like age like age like age this returns a string so we need to pass this returns a string so we need to pass this returns a string so we need to pass it to the end function it to the end function it to the end function and then store the result and then store the result and then store the result in a variable called h in a variable called h in a variable called h now let's print h to make sure we have now let's print h to make sure we have now let's print h to make sure we have implemented everything properly implemented everything properly implemented everything properly run our program run our program run our program we type 20 we type 20 we type 20 20 is printed here beautiful now look at 20 is printed here beautiful now look at 20 is printed here beautiful now look at the exit code of this program exit code the exit code of this program exit code the exit code of this program exit code 0 means our program terminated 0 means our program terminated 0 means our program terminated successfully there were no errors but successfully there were no errors but successfully there were no errors but what if we run this program what if we run this program what if we run this program one more time and instead of entering a one more time and instead of entering a one more time and instead of entering a numerical value we enter something like numerical value we enter something like numerical value we enter something like asd asd asd we get a value error we get a value error we get a value error with this message invalid literal for with this message invalid literal for with this message invalid literal for end with base 10. basically what this end with base 10. basically what this end with base 10. basically what this message is telling us is that this message is telling us is that this message is telling us is that this string asd does not contain a valid string asd does not contain a valid string asd does not contain a valid whole number that can be converted to an whole number that can be converted to an whole number that can be converted to an integer now look at the exit code of integer now look at the exit code of integer now look at the exit code of this program exit code one means our this program exit code one means our this program exit code one means our program crashed so zero always means program crashed so zero always means program crashed so zero always means success and anything but zero means success and anything but zero means success and anything but zero means crash crash crash now as a good python programmer you now as a good python programmer you now as a good python programmer you should anticipate these situations you should anticipate these situations you should anticipate these situations you don't want to let your entire program don't want to let your entire program don't want to let your entire program crash just because the user entered an crash just because the user entered an crash just because the user entered an invalid value invalid value invalid value so instead of letting the program crash so instead of letting the program crash so instead of letting the program crash you should handle this situation and you should handle this situation and you should handle this situation and print a proper error message and that's print a proper error message and that's print a proper error message and that's what i'm going to show you in this what i'm going to show you in this what i'm going to show you in this tutorial tutorial tutorial now if we're going any further now if we're going any further now if we're going any further look at the type of the error we get look at the type of the error we get look at the type of the error we get here value error so remember this we're here value error so remember this we're here value error so remember this we're going to get back to this shortly going to get back to this shortly going to get back to this shortly now how can we handle these errors now how can we handle these errors now how can we handle these errors in python we have a construct called try in python we have a construct called try in python we have a construct called try accept accept accept we use that to handle errors let me show we use that to handle errors let me show we use that to handle errors let me show you how it works so you how it works so you how it works so on the top we type try colon on the top we type try colon on the top we type try colon now as you know we're defining a code now as you know we're defining a code now as you know we're defining a code block so i'm gonna move these two lines block so i'm gonna move these two lines block so i'm gonna move these two lines inside of our try block so press tab inside of our try block so press tab inside of our try block so press tab here here here and remove this blank line and remove this blank line and remove this blank line now these two lines are part of our try now these two lines are part of our try now these two lines are part of our try block right block right block right so so so after try we type accept after try we type accept after try we type accept and then we add the type of the error and then we add the type of the error and then we add the type of the error that our program may encounter that our program may encounter that our program may encounter that is value error that is value error that is value error okay okay okay then we add a colon then we add a colon then we add a colon and in this block we can define what and in this block we can define what and in this block we can define what should happen if our program encounters should happen if our program encounters should happen if our program encounters an error of type value error an error of type value error an error of type value error in this case we want to print a proper in this case we want to print a proper in this case we want to print a proper error message so print error message so print error message so print invalid value invalid value invalid value so we just try and accept we're telling so we just try and accept we're telling so we just try and accept we're telling python hey go ahead and try running python hey go ahead and try running python hey go ahead and try running these two lines of code if you encounter these two lines of code if you encounter these two lines of code if you encounter an error of type value error then an error of type value error then an error of type value error then instead of crashing the program instead of crashing the program instead of crashing the program print this error message on the terminal print this error message on the terminal print this error message on the terminal so this is how this works so this is how this works so this is how this works now more accurately in programming terms now more accurately in programming terms now more accurately in programming terms we refer to this kind of error as an we refer to this kind of error as an we refer to this kind of error as an exception so an exception is a kind of exception so an exception is a kind of exception so an exception is a kind of error that crashes our program so if the error that crashes our program so if the error that crashes our program so if the user enters user enters user enters an invalid value this line of code line an invalid value this line of code line an invalid value this line of code line two will raise an exception and on line two will raise an exception and on line two will raise an exception and on line four we'll catch it four we'll catch it four we'll catch it and print this error message so our and print this error message so our and print this error message so our program will no longer crash let me show program will no longer crash let me show program will no longer crash let me show you so let's go ahead and run this you so let's go ahead and run this you so let's go ahead and run this age 20 age 20 age 20 everything works just like before and everything works just like before and everything works just like before and the exit code is zero beautiful let's the exit code is zero beautiful let's the exit code is zero beautiful let's rerun this program and rerun this program and rerun this program and enter asd enter asd enter asd so we get this proper error message so we get this proper error message so we get this proper error message invalid value and once again the exit invalid value and once again the exit invalid value and once again the exit code is zero so that means our program code is zero so that means our program code is zero so that means our program completed successfully didn't crash completed successfully didn't crash completed successfully didn't crash now we can also handle different kinds now we can also handle different kinds now we can also handle different kinds of errors or exceptions for example of errors or exceptions for example of errors or exceptions for example right after we get the age right after we get the age right after we get the age let's define a variable income and set let's define a variable income and set let's define a variable income and set it to 20 000 it to 20 000 it to 20 000 and then define another variable called and then define another variable called and then define another variable called risk and set it to income risk and set it to income risk and set it to income divided by h divided by h divided by h let's run this program and enter 0 as let's run this program and enter 0 as let's run this program and enter 0 as the age to see what happens the age to see what happens the age to see what happens so so so 0 is obviously a numerical value so when 0 is obviously a numerical value so when 0 is obviously a numerical value so when we enter this value technically we we enter this value technically we we enter this value technically we shouldn't get any exceptions shouldn't get any exceptions shouldn't get any exceptions take a look take a look take a look our program crashed with a zero division our program crashed with a zero division our program crashed with a zero division error because we cannot divide the error because we cannot divide the error because we cannot divide the number by zero once again look at the number by zero once again look at the number by zero once again look at the exit code so we couldn't catch this kind exit code so we couldn't catch this kind exit code so we couldn't catch this kind of error or this kind of exception of error or this kind of exception of error or this kind of exception with this except block this except block with this except block this except block with this except block this except block is only caching exceptions of type value is only caching exceptions of type value is only caching exceptions of type value error and this happens when we try to error and this happens when we try to error and this happens when we try to convert a non-numerical value to an convert a non-numerical value to an convert a non-numerical value to an integer integer integer so in a situation like this we should so in a situation like this we should so in a situation like this we should handle different kinds of exceptions handle different kinds of exceptions handle different kinds of exceptions we can add another accept statement for we can add another accept statement for we can add another accept statement for an exception of type zero division error an exception of type zero division error an exception of type zero division error now in this block we can print a now in this block we can print a now in this block we can print a different kind of message different kind of message different kind of message like age cannot be like age cannot be like age cannot be zero zero zero let's run our program one more time let's run our program one more time let's run our program one more time now i'm going to enter 0 as the age now i'm going to enter 0 as the age now i'm going to enter 0 as the age so we get this error message h can not so we get this error message h can not so we get this error message h can not be 0 and look at the exit code be 0 and look at the exit code be 0 and look at the exit code it's 0 so our program didn't crash it's 0 so our program didn't crash it's 0 so our program didn't crash so to recap we used try except blocks to so to recap we used try except blocks to so to recap we used try except blocks to handle exceptions that are raised in our handle exceptions that are raised in our handle exceptions that are raised in our programs as a good programmer you should programs as a good programmer you should programs as a good programmer you should always anticipate this kind of always anticipate this kind of always anticipate this kind of exceptions and handle them properly in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about comments in python we use you guys about comments in python we use you guys about comments in python we use comments to add notes or comments to our comments to add notes or comments to our comments to add notes or comments to our programs for example here i'm going to programs for example here i'm going to programs for example here i'm going to make a print statement make a print statement make a print statement sky is blue now before that sky is blue now before that sky is blue now before that i can add a comment using a height sign i can add a comment using a height sign i can add a comment using a height sign and then whatever i type here and then whatever i type here and then whatever i type here it's going to get ignored it's not going it's going to get ignored it's not going it's going to get ignored it's not going to get executed let me show you so let's to get executed let me show you so let's to get executed let me show you so let's run this program run this program run this program look we only see this message sky is look we only see this message sky is look we only see this message sky is blue blue blue so with this comment we can explain so with this comment we can explain so with this comment we can explain something about our code we can use that something about our code we can use that something about our code we can use that as reminders to fix things or clean as reminders to fix things or clean as reminders to fix things or clean things up or we can use it to things up or we can use it to things up or we can use it to communicate things with other developers communicate things with other developers communicate things with other developers reading our code why we have written reading our code why we have written reading our code why we have written this code in a certain way these are this code in a certain way these are this code in a certain way these are good use cases for using comments we can good use cases for using comments we can good use cases for using comments we can also have comments over multiple lines also have comments over multiple lines also have comments over multiple lines so we can simply add more comments so we can simply add more comments so we can simply add more comments each line should start with a new high each line should start with a new high each line should start with a new high sign now one thing you need to avoid sign now one thing you need to avoid sign now one thing you need to avoid when using comments is explaining what when using comments is explaining what when using comments is explaining what the code does so here's an example of a the code does so here's an example of a the code does so here's an example of a bad comment let me just delete these two bad comment let me just delete these two bad comment let me just delete these two lines lines lines and with this comment i'm going to say and with this comment i'm going to say and with this comment i'm going to say print sky is blue print sky is blue print sky is blue why is this a bad comment because it's why is this a bad comment because it's why is this a bad comment because it's telling me the obvious it is obvious telling me the obvious it is obvious telling me the obvious it is obvious that the next line is going to print sky that the next line is going to print sky that the next line is going to print sky is blue now the problem with this is blue now the problem with this is blue now the problem with this comment is that apart from being verbose comment is that apart from being verbose comment is that apart from being verbose and repetitive if we come back here and and repetitive if we come back here and and repetitive if we come back here and change sky to ocean change sky to ocean change sky to ocean now this comment gets outdated so every now this comment gets outdated so every now this comment gets outdated so every time we change this code then we'll have time we change this code then we'll have time we change this code then we'll have to come back and modify the to come back and modify the to come back and modify the corresponding comment so i've seen some corresponding comment so i've seen some corresponding comment so i've seen some developers add comments in front of developers add comments in front of developers add comments in front of their functions for example they define their functions for example they define their functions for example they define a function let's say square that takes a a function let's say square that takes a a function let's say square that takes a number and simply returns number and simply returns number and simply returns number times number well it is obvious number times number well it is obvious number times number well it is obvious that this function calculates and that this function calculates and that this function calculates and returns the square of the given number returns the square of the given number returns the square of the given number so there is really no need to add a so there is really no need to add a so there is really no need to add a comment and explain that calculates comment and explain that calculates comment and explain that calculates and returns the square of a number and returns the square of a number and returns the square of a number this is very repetitive and it creates this is very repetitive and it creates this is very repetitive and it creates noise in your code someone else reading noise in your code someone else reading noise in your code someone else reading your code they get distracted with all your code they get distracted with all your code they get distracted with all these unnecessary comments so use these unnecessary comments so use these unnecessary comments so use comments to explain whys and how not comments to explain whys and how not comments to explain whys and how not what's if you have made certain what's if you have made certain what's if you have made certain assumptions you can use comments to assumptions you can use comments to assumptions you can use comments to explain those assumptions or you can use explain those assumptions or you can use explain those assumptions or you can use them to add notes to remind yourself or them to add notes to remind yourself or them to add notes to remind yourself or other developers to do something in the other developers to do something in the other developers to do something in the code code code so comments are good but too much of a so comments are good but too much of a so comments are good but too much of a good thing is a bad thing in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about classes in python classes you guys about classes in python classes you guys about classes in python classes are extremely important in programming are extremely important in programming are extremely important in programming and they're not specific to python in and they're not specific to python in and they're not specific to python in fact a lot of other programming fact a lot of other programming fact a lot of other programming languages do support the notion of languages do support the notion of languages do support the notion of classes we use classes to define new classes we use classes to define new classes we use classes to define new types for example so far you have types for example so far you have types for example so far you have learned about the basic types in python learned about the basic types in python learned about the basic types in python like numbers strings and booleans these like numbers strings and booleans these like numbers strings and booleans these are the basic or simple types in python are the basic or simple types in python are the basic or simple types in python you also learn about a couple of complex you also learn about a couple of complex you also learn about a couple of complex types like lists and dictionaries types like lists and dictionaries types like lists and dictionaries while these types are extremely useful while these types are extremely useful while these types are extremely useful they cannot always be used to model they cannot always be used to model they cannot always be used to model complex concepts for example think of complex concepts for example think of complex concepts for example think of the concept of a point or a shopping the concept of a point or a shopping the concept of a point or a shopping cart a shopping cart is not a boolean cart a shopping cart is not a boolean cart a shopping cart is not a boolean it's not a list it's not a dictionary it's not a list it's not a dictionary it's not a list it's not a dictionary it's a different kind of thing so we can it's a different kind of thing so we can it's a different kind of thing so we can use classes to define new types to model use classes to define new types to model use classes to define new types to model real concepts real concepts real concepts now in this tutorial i'm going to show now in this tutorial i'm going to show now in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to define a new type called you how to define a new type called you how to define a new type called point and this new type is going to have point and this new type is going to have point and this new type is going to have methods for working with points for methods for working with points for methods for working with points for example back to our main program let's example back to our main program let's example back to our main program let's create a list numbers one two three create a list numbers one two three create a list numbers one two three you know that here when we type dot we you know that here when we type dot we you know that here when we type dot we get access to these functions or methods get access to these functions or methods get access to these functions or methods available in list objects now similar to available in list objects now similar to available in list objects now similar to this we're going to create a new type this we're going to create a new type this we're going to create a new type called point this point is going to have called point this point is going to have called point this point is going to have methods like move draw get distance from methods like move draw get distance from methods like move draw get distance from another point these are the operations another point these are the operations another point these are the operations that we can perform on points that we can perform on points that we can perform on points so let me show you how to do this we so let me show you how to do this we so let me show you how to do this we start by defining a class using the start by defining a class using the start by defining a class using the class keyword and right after that we class keyword and right after that we class keyword and right after that we give our class a name give our class a name give our class a name now look at the naming convention i have now look at the naming convention i have now look at the naming convention i have used here i've capitalized the first used here i've capitalized the first used here i've capitalized the first letter here this is what we call pascal letter here this is what we call pascal letter here this is what we call pascal naming convention so the convention we naming convention so the convention we naming convention so the convention we use for naming our classes is different use for naming our classes is different use for naming our classes is different from the convention we use for naming from the convention we use for naming from the convention we use for naming our variables and functions our variables and functions our variables and functions for variables and functions we always for variables and functions we always for variables and functions we always use lowercase letters and we separate use lowercase letters and we separate use lowercase letters and we separate multiple words using an underscore but multiple words using an underscore but multiple words using an underscore but when naming classes we don't use an when naming classes we don't use an when naming classes we don't use an underscore to separate multiple words underscore to separate multiple words underscore to separate multiple words instead we capitalize the first letter instead we capitalize the first letter instead we capitalize the first letter of every word so in this case our class of every word so in this case our class of every word so in this case our class has only a single word if it had has only a single word if it had has only a single word if it had multiple words let's say email client multiple words let's say email client multiple words let's say email client look i've capitalized the first letter look i've capitalized the first letter look i've capitalized the first letter of every word once again this is called of every word once again this is called of every word once again this is called pascal naming convention and it comes pascal naming convention and it comes pascal naming convention and it comes from the old pascal language that you from the old pascal language that you from the old pascal language that you might have heard of might have heard of might have heard of so so so back to our point class back to our point class back to our point class here we have a colon which means we're here we have a colon which means we're here we have a colon which means we're going to define a block going to define a block going to define a block now in this block we can define all the now in this block we can define all the now in this block we can define all the functions or methods that belong to functions or methods that belong to functions or methods that belong to points points points for example we can define a function for example we can define a function for example we can define a function called move for moving a point called move for moving a point called move for moving a point now note that as soon as we type open now note that as soon as we type open now note that as soon as we type open parenthesis pycharm automatically adds parenthesis pycharm automatically adds parenthesis pycharm automatically adds self here this is a special keyword and self here this is a special keyword and self here this is a special keyword and we're going to get back to this shortly we're going to get back to this shortly we're going to get back to this shortly so so so for now in this method let's print for now in this method let's print for now in this method let's print move on the terminal move on the terminal move on the terminal now let's define another method like now let's define another method like now let's define another method like draw draw draw so define draw so define draw so define draw and in this method let's print draw on and in this method let's print draw on and in this method let's print draw on the terminal the terminal the terminal now let's remove the indentation now let's remove the indentation now let's remove the indentation we're done with the definition of our we're done with the definition of our we're done with the definition of our point class so we need to add two line point class so we need to add two line point class so we need to add two line breaks breaks breaks okay okay okay so with this class we defined a new type so with this class we defined a new type so with this class we defined a new type with this new type we can create new with this new type we can create new with this new type we can create new objects so an object is an instance of a objects so an object is an instance of a objects so an object is an instance of a class a class simply defines the class a class simply defines the class a class simply defines the blueprint or the template for creating blueprint or the template for creating blueprint or the template for creating objects and objects are the actual objects and objects are the actual objects and objects are the actual instances based on that blueprint so we instances based on that blueprint so we instances based on that blueprint so we could have tens or hundreds of points on could have tens or hundreds of points on could have tens or hundreds of points on the screen these are the objects or the the screen these are the objects or the the screen these are the objects or the instances instances instances so to create an object we type out the so to create an object we type out the so to create an object we type out the name of our class name of our class name of our class and then call it like a function and then call it like a function and then call it like a function this creates a new object and then this creates a new object and then this creates a new object and then returns it so we can store that object returns it so we can store that object returns it so we can store that object in a variable let's call that point one in a variable let's call that point one in a variable let's call that point one there you go there you go there you go now when we use the dot operator now when we use the dot operator now when we use the dot operator look we have look we have look we have these two methods that we defined draw these two methods that we defined draw these two methods that we defined draw and move we also have a bunch of other and move we also have a bunch of other and move we also have a bunch of other methods that start with two underscores methods that start with two underscores methods that start with two underscores these are called magic methods we'll these are called magic methods we'll these are called magic methods we'll look at them later in the course look at them later in the course look at them later in the course so now let's call the draw method of our so now let's call the draw method of our so now let's call the draw method of our point object and point object and point object and run our program so you can see draw is run our program so you can see draw is run our program so you can see draw is printed on the terminal printed on the terminal printed on the terminal now apart from methods these objects can now apart from methods these objects can now apart from methods these objects can also have attributes and these also have attributes and these also have attributes and these attributes are like variables that attributes are like variables that attributes are like variables that belong to a particular object for belong to a particular object for belong to a particular object for example here example here example here after we define point one after we define point one after we define point one we can set point 1 dot x to 10 and point we can set point 1 dot x to 10 and point we can set point 1 dot x to 10 and point 1 dot y to 20. 1 dot y to 20. 1 dot y to 20. now we can easily print out this now we can easily print out this now we can easily print out this attributes let's print attributes let's print attributes let's print 0.1.x 0.1.x 0.1.x and run our program one more time take a and run our program one more time take a and run our program one more time take a look so the x coordinate of point one is look so the x coordinate of point one is look so the x coordinate of point one is ten now we can create another object ten now we can create another object ten now we can create another object let's call that point two let's call that point two let's call that point two so point two so point two so point two once again we type out the name of our once again we type out the name of our once again we type out the name of our class and then call it like a function class and then call it like a function class and then call it like a function now this object is completely different now this object is completely different now this object is completely different from the first object so if we print from the first object so if we print from the first object so if we print point 2 dot x flow can we get this attribute error flow can we get this attribute error flow can we get this attribute error because this point object doesn't have because this point object doesn't have because this point object doesn't have an attribute called x an attribute called x an attribute called x so each object is a different instance so each object is a different instance so each object is a different instance of a point class of a point class of a point class and here we can assign a value to point and here we can assign a value to point and here we can assign a value to point two dot x two dot x two dot x let's set that to one and then run our let's set that to one and then run our let's set that to one and then run our program so we can see the x coordinate program so we can see the x coordinate program so we can see the x coordinate of 0.2 is 1. of 0.2 is 1. of 0.2 is 1. so to recap so to recap so to recap we use classes to define new types we use classes to define new types we use classes to define new types these types can have methods that we these types can have methods that we these types can have methods that we define in the body of the class and they define in the body of the class and they define in the body of the class and they can also have attributes that we can set can also have attributes that we can set can also have attributes that we can set anywhere in our programs you have learned how to create new types you have learned how to create new types you have learned how to create new types using classes now there is a tiny using classes now there is a tiny using classes now there is a tiny problem in this implementation problem in this implementation problem in this implementation we can create a point object without an we can create a point object without an we can create a point object without an x or y coordinates let me show you so x or y coordinates let me show you so x or y coordinates let me show you so point point point we create this object here and before we we create this object here and before we we create this object here and before we set set set point.x let's print point.x point.x let's print point.x point.x let's print point.x run our program run our program run our program we get this attribute error that you saw we get this attribute error that you saw we get this attribute error that you saw in the last tutorial so point object has in the last tutorial so point object has in the last tutorial so point object has no attribute called x no attribute called x no attribute called x this is the problem we have here it is this is the problem we have here it is this is the problem we have here it is possible to have a point object without possible to have a point object without possible to have a point object without an x or y coordinates and that doesn't an x or y coordinates and that doesn't an x or y coordinates and that doesn't really make sense because whenever we really make sense because whenever we really make sense because whenever we talk about a point we need to know where talk about a point we need to know where talk about a point we need to know where that point is located to solve this that point is located to solve this that point is located to solve this problem we use a constructor a problem we use a constructor a problem we use a constructor a constructor is a function that gets constructor is a function that gets constructor is a function that gets called at the time of creating an object called at the time of creating an object called at the time of creating an object so here on line 9 when creating this so here on line 9 when creating this so here on line 9 when creating this point object we want to pass values for point object we want to pass values for point object we want to pass values for x and y coordinates let's say 10 x and y coordinates let's say 10 x and y coordinates let's say 10 and 20 and with this this point object and 20 and with this this point object and 20 and with this this point object that we get here will have its x and y that we get here will have its x and y that we get here will have its x and y coordinates initialized so how do we do coordinates initialized so how do we do coordinates initialized so how do we do this we need to add a special method in this we need to add a special method in this we need to add a special method in this class called constructor this class called constructor this class called constructor so on the top so on the top so on the top we define a new function we define a new function we define a new function look at the name of this function double look at the name of this function double look at the name of this function double underscore underscore underscore init double underscore init double underscore init double underscore so init is short for initialize and this so init is short for initialize and this so init is short for initialize and this is the function or the method that gets is the function or the method that gets is the function or the method that gets called when we create a new point object called when we create a new point object called when we create a new point object now press enter now press enter now press enter so this automatically adds so this automatically adds so this automatically adds self in parenthesis we're going to come self in parenthesis we're going to come self in parenthesis we're going to come back to this shortly back to this shortly back to this shortly now right after self we want to add two now right after self we want to add two now right after self we want to add two extra parameters x and y so let's type extra parameters x and y so let's type extra parameters x and y so let's type out x and y out x and y out x and y and then in the body of this method we and then in the body of this method we and then in the body of this method we should read the values passed here and should read the values passed here and should read the values passed here and use them to initialize our object so use them to initialize our object so use them to initialize our object so when we pass 10 and 20 these arguments when we pass 10 and 20 these arguments when we pass 10 and 20 these arguments will be used for will be used for will be used for x and y parameters x and y parameters x and y parameters now to initialize our object we type out now to initialize our object we type out now to initialize our object we type out code like this self dot x equals x code like this self dot x equals x code like this self dot x equals x and then self.y equals y what is going and then self.y equals y what is going and then self.y equals y what is going on here on here on here this self that you see here is a this self that you see here is a this self that you see here is a reference to the current object reference to the current object reference to the current object so so so back to line 13 when we create a new back to line 13 when we create a new back to line 13 when we create a new point object self references that object point object self references that object point object self references that object in memory the same object that we are in memory the same object that we are in memory the same object that we are referencing using this variable referencing using this variable referencing using this variable so earlier we typed point that x equals so earlier we typed point that x equals so earlier we typed point that x equals 10 with this code we set the x attribute 10 with this code we set the x attribute 10 with this code we set the x attribute of this point object now what we have in of this point object now what we have in of this point object now what we have in the constructor is exactly the same the constructor is exactly the same the constructor is exactly the same we're using self to reference the we're using self to reference the we're using self to reference the current object and then we set the x current object and then we set the x current object and then we set the x attribute to the x argument passed to attribute to the x argument passed to attribute to the x argument passed to this function this function this function so using this init method we can so using this init method we can so using this init method we can initialize our objects initialize our objects initialize our objects and we refer to this method as a and we refer to this method as a and we refer to this method as a constructor this method is used to constructor this method is used to constructor this method is used to construct or create an object okay construct or create an object okay construct or create an object okay so so so now now now let's remove line 14. so we create a let's remove line 14. so we create a let's remove line 14. so we create a point object with these values and then point object with these values and then point object with these values and then print point.x let's run our program print point.x let's run our program print point.x let's run our program there you go x is 10. we can also change there you go x is 10. we can also change there you go x is 10. we can also change these values later so just before these values later so just before these values later so just before printing point.x we can set point.x to printing point.x we can set point.x to printing point.x we can set point.x to 11 and then run our program so x is 11 and then run our program so x is 11 and then run our program so x is updated beautiful updated beautiful updated beautiful all right here's an exercise for you i all right here's an exercise for you i all right here's an exercise for you i want you to define a new type called want you to define a new type called want you to define a new type called person person person these personal objects should have a these personal objects should have a these personal objects should have a name attribute as well as a talk name attribute as well as a talk name attribute as well as a talk method method method this is a very easy exercise so you can this is a very easy exercise so you can this is a very easy exercise so you can tackle it in probably a couple of tackle it in probably a couple of tackle it in probably a couple of minutes all right so first we start with the all right so first we start with the all right so first we start with the class keyword we define this person class keyword we define this person class keyword we define this person class once again look at the naming class once again look at the naming class once again look at the naming convention i have used here the first convention i have used here the first convention i have used here the first letter of the first word in this case letter of the first word in this case letter of the first word in this case the only word is uppercase the only word is uppercase the only word is uppercase now in this class we define all the now in this class we define all the now in this class we define all the methods that we need currently we have methods that we need currently we have methods that we need currently we have only one method that is the talk method only one method that is the talk method only one method that is the talk method so define talk so define talk so define talk pycharm automatically adds self we come pycharm automatically adds self we come pycharm automatically adds self we come back to this shortly back to this shortly back to this shortly for now let's just print talk for now let's just print talk for now let's just print talk so this is the body of our person class so this is the body of our person class so this is the body of our person class we remove the indentation we remove the indentation we remove the indentation and add two line breaks after defining and add two line breaks after defining and add two line breaks after defining our classes our classes our classes now we can create a personal object now we can create a personal object now we can create a personal object let's call that john let's call that john let's call that john we set it to person we set it to person we set it to person we can call john.talk we can call john.talk we can call john.talk let's run the program let's run the program let's run the program so we get this message beautiful but our so we get this message beautiful but our so we get this message beautiful but our personal objects should also have personal objects should also have personal objects should also have a name attribute it doesn't make sense a name attribute it doesn't make sense a name attribute it doesn't make sense to have a person without a name so that to have a person without a name so that to have a person without a name so that is when we use the constructor function is when we use the constructor function is when we use the constructor function so on the top we add a new method so on the top we add a new method so on the top we add a new method the name of this method is double the name of this method is double the name of this method is double underscore init double underscore underscore init double underscore underscore init double underscore so we call this method a constructor so we call this method a constructor so we call this method a constructor now in this method we need to add now in this method we need to add now in this method we need to add another parameter that is name another parameter that is name another parameter that is name so we simply set self.name to name so we simply set self.name to name so we simply set self.name to name once again self references the current once again self references the current once again self references the current object so we're setting the name object so we're setting the name object so we're setting the name attribute of the current object to the attribute of the current object to the attribute of the current object to the name argument passed to this method name argument passed to this method name argument passed to this method with this we can go back to line nine with this we can go back to line nine with this we can go back to line nine and when creating a personal object we and when creating a personal object we and when creating a personal object we pass the name let's say john smith pass the name let's say john smith pass the name let's say john smith now let's print john dot name now let's print john dot name now let's print john dot name and run our program there you go so john and run our program there you go so john and run our program there you go so john smith is printed on the terminal smith is printed on the terminal smith is printed on the terminal beautiful so this is all you had to do beautiful so this is all you had to do beautiful so this is all you had to do as part of this exercise but let's make as part of this exercise but let's make as part of this exercise but let's make this program a little bit more this program a little bit more this program a little bit more interesting interesting interesting instead of printing this boring message instead of printing this boring message instead of printing this boring message here let's print hi i am john smith here let's print hi i am john smith here let's print hi i am john smith so we can use a formatted string with a so we can use a formatted string with a so we can use a formatted string with a message like hi message like hi message like hi i am now we want to dynamically add the i am now we want to dynamically add the i am now we want to dynamically add the name of this person how do we do that name of this person how do we do that name of this person how do we do that well look at the parameter well look at the parameter well look at the parameter of this talk method as i told you before of this talk method as i told you before of this talk method as i told you before every method in our class should have every method in our class should have every method in our class should have this parameter self and this should be this parameter self and this should be this parameter self and this should be the very first parameter of every method the very first parameter of every method the very first parameter of every method okay so with itself we can get reference okay so with itself we can get reference okay so with itself we can get reference to the current object to the current object to the current object so so so we can add curly braces and type out we can add curly braces and type out we can add curly braces and type out self dot name self dot name self dot name this returns the name attribute of the this returns the name attribute of the this returns the name attribute of the current person object current person object current person object with this we can remove with this we can remove with this we can remove line 10 line 10 line 10 where we print john.name and simply call where we print john.name and simply call where we print john.name and simply call john.talk john.talk john.talk let's run our program let's run our program let's run our program hi i am john smith beautiful hi i am john smith beautiful hi i am john smith beautiful now we can create another personal now we can create another personal now we can create another personal object let's say bob object let's say bob object let's say bob it's a new person it's a new person it's a new person called bob smith called bob smith called bob smith when we say when we say when we say bob.talk bob.talk bob.talk and run our program and run our program and run our program we get a different message hi i'm bob we get a different message hi i'm bob we get a different message hi i'm bob smith so each object is a different smith so each object is a different smith so each object is a different instance of a person class in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about inheritance in python you guys about inheritance in python you guys about inheritance in python inheritance is a mechanism for reusing inheritance is a mechanism for reusing inheritance is a mechanism for reusing code and once again it's not limited to code and once again it's not limited to code and once again it's not limited to python most languages that support python most languages that support python most languages that support classes also support inheritance so let classes also support inheritance so let classes also support inheritance so let me show you how it works let's say we me show you how it works let's say we me show you how it works let's say we have this dot class with a simple walk have this dot class with a simple walk have this dot class with a simple walk method in this method we're simply method in this method we're simply method in this method we're simply printing the walk message on the printing the walk message on the printing the walk message on the terminal now let's say in a real program terminal now let's say in a real program terminal now let's say in a real program instead of just one line of code here instead of just one line of code here instead of just one line of code here we're going to have 10 lines of code we're going to have 10 lines of code we're going to have 10 lines of code now what if in the future we want to now what if in the future we want to now what if in the future we want to define another class let's say cat define another class let's say cat define another class let's say cat and we want to add this walk method and we want to add this walk method and we want to add this walk method there as well we'll have to repeat all there as well we'll have to repeat all there as well we'll have to repeat all that code in this new class that code in this new class that code in this new class walk walk walk this is bad because we have repeated or this is bad because we have repeated or this is bad because we have repeated or duplicated our code in programming we duplicated our code in programming we duplicated our code in programming we have a principle called dry which is have a principle called dry which is have a principle called dry which is short for don't repeat yourself and short for don't repeat yourself and short for don't repeat yourself and here's the reason here's the reason here's the reason let's say sometime in the future we let's say sometime in the future we let's say sometime in the future we discover a problem in our walk method if discover a problem in our walk method if discover a problem in our walk method if we have repeated or duplicated this we have repeated or duplicated this we have repeated or duplicated this method in many other places then we'll method in many other places then we'll method in many other places then we'll have to come back and fix that problem have to come back and fix that problem have to come back and fix that problem in every single place we have duplicated in every single place we have duplicated in every single place we have duplicated this code so that's why in programming this code so that's why in programming this code so that's why in programming we should not define something twice we should not define something twice we should not define something twice so how can we solve this problem so how can we solve this problem so how can we solve this problem well there are different approaches one well there are different approaches one well there are different approaches one approach which is easier to understand approach which is easier to understand approach which is easier to understand for beginners is inheritance and here's for beginners is inheritance and here's for beginners is inheritance and here's how it works we define a new class how it works we define a new class how it works we define a new class called mammal and move the walk method called mammal and move the walk method called mammal and move the walk method right there right there right there then we'll have the dog and cat classes then we'll have the dog and cat classes then we'll have the dog and cat classes inherit that method from their parent inherit that method from their parent inherit that method from their parent just like how humans inherit certain just like how humans inherit certain just like how humans inherit certain attributes or behaviors from their attributes or behaviors from their attributes or behaviors from their parents it's exactly the same parents it's exactly the same parents it's exactly the same so so so on the top we're defining a new class on the top we're defining a new class on the top we're defining a new class let's call it mammal let's call it mammal let's call it mammal then we need to move the walk method then we need to move the walk method then we need to move the walk method there so we select it cut it using there so we select it cut it using there so we select it cut it using command x on mac or control x on windows command x on mac or control x on windows command x on mac or control x on windows and then paste it here and then paste it here and then paste it here beautiful beautiful beautiful now we want our dot class to inherit now we want our dot class to inherit now we want our dot class to inherit this method from the mammal class so this method from the mammal class so this method from the mammal class so right after the class name we add right after the class name we add right after the class name we add parenthesis and then type out the name parenthesis and then type out the name parenthesis and then type out the name of the parent class in this case mammal of the parent class in this case mammal of the parent class in this case mammal that's all we had to do that's all we had to do that's all we had to do so with this the dot class will inherit so with this the dot class will inherit so with this the dot class will inherit all the methods defined in the mammal all the methods defined in the mammal all the methods defined in the mammal class now there's a tiny problem here class now there's a tiny problem here class now there's a tiny problem here if you look at line 9 there is a red if you look at line 9 there is a red if you look at line 9 there is a red underline here underline here underline here the reason this is happening is because the reason this is happening is because the reason this is happening is because python doesn't like an empty class python doesn't like an empty class python doesn't like an empty class so right now our dot class is empty it so right now our dot class is empty it so right now our dot class is empty it doesn't have anything we either need to doesn't have anything we either need to doesn't have anything we either need to add methods specific to dogs or just to add methods specific to dogs or just to add methods specific to dogs or just to make python happy we can use the pass make python happy we can use the pass make python happy we can use the pass statement and that basically means statement and that basically means statement and that basically means nothing we're telling python interpreter nothing we're telling python interpreter nothing we're telling python interpreter hey pass this line don't worry about it hey pass this line don't worry about it hey pass this line don't worry about it but with this we don't have an empty but with this we don't have an empty but with this we don't have an empty class okay class okay class okay now as i told you before after each now as i told you before after each now as i told you before after each class you should have two line breaks so class you should have two line breaks so class you should have two line breaks so right now we only have one line break right now we only have one line break right now we only have one line break and that is the reason we have this and that is the reason we have this and that is the reason we have this little warning here so let's add another little warning here so let's add another little warning here so let's add another black line beautiful black line beautiful black line beautiful so our dog class is inheriting the walk so our dog class is inheriting the walk so our dog class is inheriting the walk method from the mammal we need to apply method from the mammal we need to apply method from the mammal we need to apply the same change to the cat class so the same change to the cat class so the same change to the cat class so we'll have cat we'll have cat we'll have cat inherit from mammal inherit from mammal inherit from mammal and then and then and then we use the pass statement here we use the pass statement here we use the pass statement here with these changes now we can create with these changes now we can create with these changes now we can create either a dog or a cat object let's say either a dog or a cat object let's say either a dog or a cat object let's say dog one dog one dog one we set it to a dog object we set it to a dog object we set it to a dog object and when we type and when we type and when we type dot look we have the walk method that is dot look we have the walk method that is dot look we have the walk method that is defined in the mammal class we can defined in the mammal class we can defined in the mammal class we can easily call it let's run our program easily call it let's run our program easily call it let's run our program there you go we see the walk message there you go we see the walk message there you go we see the walk message so both the dog and cat classes are so both the dog and cat classes are so both the dog and cat classes are inheriting all the methods defined in inheriting all the methods defined in inheriting all the methods defined in their parent class now here we can add their parent class now here we can add their parent class now here we can add methods specific to dogs for example we methods specific to dogs for example we methods specific to dogs for example we can define can define can define a method called bark a method called bark a method called bark and then print bark and then print bark and then print bark now we don't need the pass statement now we don't need the pass statement now we don't need the pass statement because we already defined one method in because we already defined one method in because we already defined one method in our dog class our dog class our dog class so now when we type out dog one dot so now when we type out dog one dot so now when we type out dog one dot look we have two methods one is the walk look we have two methods one is the walk look we have two methods one is the walk method that we inherited and the bark method that we inherited and the bark method that we inherited and the bark method that we just defined in the dog method that we just defined in the dog method that we just defined in the dog class similarly we can add a method class similarly we can add a method class similarly we can add a method specific to a cat for example we can specific to a cat for example we can specific to a cat for example we can define a method called be define a method called be define a method called be annoying yeah i hate cats so annoying yeah i hate cats so annoying yeah i hate cats so let's print let's print let's print annoying annoying annoying now when we create a cat object let's now when we create a cat object let's now when we create a cat object let's remove that cat one remove that cat one remove that cat one and type out cat one dot we have these and type out cat one dot we have these and type out cat one dot we have these two methods walk and bnoy two methods walk and bnoy two methods walk and bnoy so these are the basics of inheritance so these are the basics of inheritance so these are the basics of inheritance in python now there is more to this that in python now there is more to this that in python now there is more to this that really goes beyond the scope of this really goes beyond the scope of this really goes beyond the scope of this beginner's tutorial if you're interested beginner's tutorial if you're interested beginner's tutorial if you're interested to learn more about inheritance and to learn more about inheritance and to learn more about inheritance and other mechanisms for reusing code i other mechanisms for reusing code i other mechanisms for reusing code i encourage you to get my complete python encourage you to get my complete python encourage you to get my complete python course in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about modules in python a you guys about modules in python a you guys about modules in python a module in python is basically a file module in python is basically a file module in python is basically a file with some python code and we use modules with some python code and we use modules with some python code and we use modules to organize our code into multiple files to organize our code into multiple files to organize our code into multiple files just like sections and a supermarket just like sections and a supermarket just like sections and a supermarket when you go to a supermarket there are when you go to a supermarket there are when you go to a supermarket there are different sections for fruits vegetables different sections for fruits vegetables different sections for fruits vegetables cleaning products and so on we don't cleaning products and so on we don't cleaning products and so on we don't have one section with all the products have one section with all the products have one section with all the products in the supermarket we have the same in the supermarket we have the same in the supermarket we have the same concept in programming so instead of concept in programming so instead of concept in programming so instead of writing all of our code instead of writing all of our code instead of writing all of our code instead of writing all the functions and classes in writing all the functions and classes in writing all the functions and classes in app.pi we want to break up our code into app.pi we want to break up our code into app.pi we want to break up our code into multiple files we refer to each file as multiple files we refer to each file as multiple files we refer to each file as a module with this not only is our code a module with this not only is our code a module with this not only is our code better organized and structured but better organized and structured but better organized and structured but we'll also have the ability to reuse our we'll also have the ability to reuse our we'll also have the ability to reuse our code for example over here in app.pi code for example over here in app.pi code for example over here in app.pi i've defined two functions for i've defined two functions for i've defined two functions for converting weight from pounds to converting weight from pounds to converting weight from pounds to kilograms and vice versa kilograms and vice versa kilograms and vice versa now we can take these two functions and now we can take these two functions and now we can take these two functions and put them in a separate module called put them in a separate module called put them in a separate module called converters and then we can import that converters and then we can import that converters and then we can import that module into any program that needs this module into any program that needs this module into any program that needs this converter functions let me show you how converter functions let me show you how converter functions let me show you how to do this so to do this so to do this so let's open up our project panel and let's open up our project panel and let's open up our project panel and right click the project right click the project right click the project go to new and add a new file go to new and add a new file go to new and add a new file we're going to call this file converters we're going to call this file converters we're going to call this file converters dot pi dot pi dot pi then we go back to app.pi then we go back to app.pi then we go back to app.pi select all this code cut it and then select all this code cut it and then select all this code cut it and then paste it into our new module paste it into our new module paste it into our new module converters.pi converters.pi converters.pi with this we have cleaned up our app with this we have cleaned up our app with this we have cleaned up our app module it's not bloated with different module it's not bloated with different module it's not bloated with different functions so as we write more functions functions so as we write more functions functions so as we write more functions and classes we put them in their and classes we put them in their and classes we put them in their corresponding modules corresponding modules corresponding modules a module should contain all the related a module should contain all the related a module should contain all the related functions and classes okay functions and classes okay functions and classes okay now you want to import the converters now you want to import the converters now you want to import the converters module into our app module and that is module into our app module and that is module into our app module and that is really easy on the top right really easy on the top right really easy on the top right import import import converters converters converters without the extension so we don't add without the extension so we don't add without the extension so we don't add dot pi we only type out the name of the dot pi we only type out the name of the dot pi we only type out the name of the file file file let me close the project panel let me close the project panel let me close the project panel now this converter is an object so we now this converter is an object so we now this converter is an object so we can use the data operator to access its can use the data operator to access its can use the data operator to access its members so currently we have defined members so currently we have defined members so currently we have defined these two functions inside of our module these two functions inside of our module these two functions inside of our module kilogram to pounds and pounds to kilogram to pounds and pounds to kilogram to pounds and pounds to kilogram kilogram kilogram so we can easily call one of these so we can easily call one of these so we can easily call one of these functions let's pass 70 kilos get the functions let's pass 70 kilos get the functions let's pass 70 kilos get the result and print it out result and print it out result and print it out run our program run our program run our program so so so that is 155 pounds that is 155 pounds that is 155 pounds now there is also another syntax for now there is also another syntax for now there is also another syntax for importing modules let me show you so importing modules let me show you so importing modules let me show you so instead of importing the entire module instead of importing the entire module instead of importing the entire module we can import specific functions from we can import specific functions from we can import specific functions from that module here's how it works we type that module here's how it works we type that module here's how it works we type out from out from out from then we add the name of our module so then we add the name of our module so then we add the name of our module so converters converters converters import now here if you press control and import now here if you press control and import now here if you press control and space you can see the list of all the space you can see the list of all the space you can see the list of all the functions defined in this module so here functions defined in this module so here functions defined in this module so here we can grab one of these functions let's we can grab one of these functions let's we can grab one of these functions let's say kilogram to pounds and with this we say kilogram to pounds and with this we say kilogram to pounds and with this we can directly can directly can directly call this function just like a function call this function just like a function call this function just like a function defined in this file app.pi defined in this file app.pi defined in this file app.pi compare what we have on line 4 with what compare what we have on line 4 with what compare what we have on line 4 with what we have on line 6. on line 6 we'll have we have on line 6. on line 6 we'll have we have on line 6. on line 6 we'll have to prefix this function call with the to prefix this function call with the to prefix this function call with the name of an object converters so we have name of an object converters so we have name of an object converters so we have to type converters dot and then we'll be to type converters dot and then we'll be to type converters dot and then we'll be able to access this function able to access this function able to access this function in contrast when we import a specific in contrast when we import a specific in contrast when we import a specific function from our module then we can function from our module then we can function from our module then we can easily call that function without easily call that function without easily call that function without prefixing it with the module name so prefixing it with the module name so prefixing it with the module name so here's what you need to take away we use here's what you need to take away we use here's what you need to take away we use modules to better organize our code modules to better organize our code modules to better organize our code instead of writing all the code instead instead of writing all the code instead instead of writing all the code instead of writing all our functions in one file of writing all our functions in one file of writing all our functions in one file we break up our code across multiple we break up our code across multiple we break up our code across multiple files each file is called a module and files each file is called a module and files each file is called a module and it should contain all the related it should contain all the related it should contain all the related functions and classes functions and classes functions and classes then we can import a module into another then we can import a module into another then we can import a module into another module in this case we are importing the module in this case we are importing the module in this case we are importing the converters module into our app module converters module into our app module converters module into our app module and as you saw there are two ways to and as you saw there are two ways to and as you saw there are two ways to import a module we can import the entire import a module we can import the entire import a module we can import the entire module and then we'll get an object with module and then we'll get an object with module and then we'll get an object with the same name as the module so we can the same name as the module so we can the same name as the module so we can type converters dot and then we'll be type converters dot and then we'll be type converters dot and then we'll be able to access all the functions and able to access all the functions and able to access all the functions and classes defined in this module the other classes defined in this module the other classes defined in this module the other approach is to import a specific approach is to import a specific approach is to import a specific function or class from a module using function or class from a module using function or class from a module using the from import statement the from import statement the from import statement now here's your exercise earlier in the now here's your exercise earlier in the now here's your exercise earlier in the course we had an exercise for finding course we had an exercise for finding course we had an exercise for finding the largest number in the list the largest number in the list the largest number in the list so here on the top we have a list of so here on the top we have a list of so here on the top we have a list of numbers initially we set max for the numbers initially we set max for the numbers initially we set max for the first number in this list first number in this list first number in this list then we loop through this list get each then we loop through this list get each then we loop through this list get each number number number if the current number is greater than if the current number is greater than if the current number is greater than max then we reset max and finally when max then we reset max and finally when max then we reset max and finally when we're done with our loop we print max on we're done with our loop we print max on we're done with our loop we print max on the terminal now here's what i wanted to the terminal now here's what i wanted to the terminal now here's what i wanted to do this code currently has no do this code currently has no do this code currently has no organization we don't have any functions organization we don't have any functions organization we don't have any functions we don't have any modules we wrote all we don't have any modules we wrote all we don't have any modules we wrote all the code in app.pi and that is okay for the code in app.pi and that is okay for the code in app.pi and that is okay for small programs but as your programs grow small programs but as your programs grow small programs but as your programs grow you need to properly organize your code you need to properly organize your code you need to properly organize your code into functions classes and modules into functions classes and modules into functions classes and modules so as part of this exercise i want you so as part of this exercise i want you so as part of this exercise i want you to write a function call it find to write a function call it find to write a function call it find max max max this function should take a list and this function should take a list and this function should take a list and return the largest number in that list return the largest number in that list return the largest number in that list now after you do this go ahead and put now after you do this go ahead and put now after you do this go ahead and put this function in a separate module so this function in a separate module so this function in a separate module so extract it from here and put it in a extract it from here and put it in a extract it from here and put it in a module called utils module called utils module called utils so in this module we're going to have a so in this module we're going to have a so in this module we're going to have a bunch of utility functions bunch of utility functions bunch of utility functions okay okay okay then then then import the utils module into the current import the utils module into the current import the utils module into the current module and call this function module and call this function module and call this function finally get the result and print it on finally get the result and print it on finally get the result and print it on the terminal this is a fantastic the terminal this is a fantastic the terminal this is a fantastic exercise to teach you how to properly exercise to teach you how to properly exercise to teach you how to properly organize your code so go ahead and spend organize your code so go ahead and spend organize your code so go ahead and spend a couple of minutes on this exercise so the first step is to define a so the first step is to define a so the first step is to define a function called find max function called find max function called find max so on the top i'm going to define a so on the top i'm going to define a so on the top i'm going to define a function function function find max find max find max this function should take a list of this function should take a list of this function should take a list of numbers so we add a parameter called numbers so we add a parameter called numbers so we add a parameter called numbers numbers numbers now instead of this function we want to now instead of this function we want to now instead of this function we want to have these few lines this is the have these few lines this is the have these few lines this is the algorithm for finding the largest number algorithm for finding the largest number algorithm for finding the largest number in the list we don't want to bring the in the list we don't want to bring the in the list we don't want to bring the first line because this is where we first line because this is where we first line because this is where we create a list so somewhere in our create a list so somewhere in our create a list so somewhere in our program we're going to create this list program we're going to create this list program we're going to create this list and then pass it as an argument to find and then pass it as an argument to find and then pass it as an argument to find max function okay so max function okay so max function okay so let's go ahead and grab these few lines let's go ahead and grab these few lines let's go ahead and grab these few lines cut them and cut them and cut them and put them inside of find max function put them inside of find max function put them inside of find max function all right so we find the largest number all right so we find the largest number all right so we find the largest number in this list finally we need to return in this list finally we need to return in this list finally we need to return it so it so it so return return return max max max so here's our function now we need to so here's our function now we need to so here's our function now we need to move this into a separate module so move this into a separate module so move this into a separate module so let's go to the project panel let's go to the project panel let's go to the project panel right click the project right click the project right click the project and add a new file we can also add a new and add a new file we can also add a new and add a new file we can also add a new python file is the same python file is the same python file is the same let's call that utils let's call that utils let's call that utils so if you add a new python file pycharm so if you add a new python file pycharm so if you add a new python file pycharm automatically adds dot pi extension but automatically adds dot pi extension but automatically adds dot pi extension but if you go to if you go to if you go to new file we'll have to explicitly type new file we'll have to explicitly type new file we'll have to explicitly type out dot pi out dot pi out dot pi so make sure to get the extension right so make sure to get the extension right so make sure to get the extension right now back to app.pi now back to app.pi now back to app.pi let's cut this code and paste it into let's cut this code and paste it into let's cut this code and paste it into this new module this new module this new module okay beautiful okay beautiful okay beautiful now we go back to app.pi and import our now we go back to app.pi and import our now we go back to app.pi and import our new module we can either import the new module we can either import the new module we can either import the entire module entire module entire module so import utils and then access so import utils and then access so import utils and then access individual functions so we can call individual functions so we can call individual functions so we can call utils dot find max or we can explicitly utils dot find max or we can explicitly utils dot find max or we can explicitly import this function from the utils import this function from the utils import this function from the utils module it doesn't really make a module it doesn't really make a module it doesn't really make a difference so difference so difference so we could type from utils import we could type from utils import we could type from utils import find max find max find max and then and then and then we don't need to prefix this with the we don't need to prefix this with the we don't need to prefix this with the name of its object so we simply call name of its object so we simply call name of its object so we simply call find max find max find max now we need to call this after we now we need to call this after we now we need to call this after we initialize our list initialize our list initialize our list so first we need to define the list of so first we need to define the list of so first we need to define the list of numbers numbers numbers then then then we pass that list as an argument to find we pass that list as an argument to find we pass that list as an argument to find max we get the result which is max and max we get the result which is max and max we get the result which is max and finally we print it on the terminal finally we print it on the terminal finally we print it on the terminal let's go ahead and run our program let's go ahead and run our program let's go ahead and run our program so the largest number in this list is so the largest number in this list is so the largest number in this list is 10. beautiful now one last thing before 10. beautiful now one last thing before 10. beautiful now one last thing before we finish this tutorial we finish this tutorial we finish this tutorial here we have this little warning under here we have this little warning under here we have this little warning under max and the tooltip says shadows max and the tooltip says shadows max and the tooltip says shadows built-in name max the reason we see this built-in name max the reason we see this built-in name max the reason we see this is because in python we actually have a is because in python we actually have a is because in python we actually have a function called max and it does the function called max and it does the function called max and it does the exact same job as our find max function exact same job as our find max function exact same job as our find max function so this is actually built into python so this is actually built into python so this is actually built into python but i ask you to do it as an exercise but i ask you to do it as an exercise but i ask you to do it as an exercise because it's a great exercise for because it's a great exercise for because it's a great exercise for beginners now back to the warning beginners now back to the warning beginners now back to the warning this warning is basically telling us this warning is basically telling us this warning is basically telling us that we are overwriting the built-in max that we are overwriting the built-in max that we are overwriting the built-in max function in python so we're changing the function in python so we're changing the function in python so we're changing the meaning of this function and this is meaning of this function and this is meaning of this function and this is considered a bad practice let me show considered a bad practice let me show considered a bad practice let me show you what i mean so let's comment out you what i mean so let's comment out you what i mean so let's comment out what we have on line four by putting a what we have on line four by putting a what we have on line four by putting a heist line here we can also use heist line here we can also use heist line here we can also use a shortcut command and slash on mac or a shortcut command and slash on mac or a shortcut command and slash on mac or ctrl and slash on windows ctrl and slash on windows ctrl and slash on windows so now this line is commented out look so now this line is commented out look so now this line is commented out look at the color max here it's purple it's at the color max here it's purple it's at the color max here it's purple it's the same color as print and this is the the same color as print and this is the the same color as print and this is the color used to identify the built-in color used to identify the built-in color used to identify the built-in functions functions functions so now we can call this function so now we can call this function so now we can call this function and give it and give it and give it our list of numbers our list of numbers our list of numbers run our program run our program run our program we get the exact same result however we get the exact same result however we get the exact same result however if we bring this line back once again we if we bring this line back once again we if we bring this line back once again we can use the same shortcut that is can use the same shortcut that is can use the same shortcut that is command and slash on mac or ctrl slash command and slash on mac or ctrl slash command and slash on mac or ctrl slash on windows on windows on windows now we are redefining max so up to this now we are redefining max so up to this now we are redefining max so up to this line max used to be a function but after line max used to be a function but after line max used to be a function but after line 4 is executed max is set to an line 4 is executed max is set to an line 4 is executed max is set to an integer that is the largest number in integer that is the largest number in integer that is the largest number in this list this list this list so we'll no longer be able to call it so we'll no longer be able to call it so we'll no longer be able to call it on line 5. on line 5. on line 5. let's run our program and see what let's run our program and see what let's run our program and see what happens happens happens so there you go we get this type error so there you go we get this type error so there you go we get this type error int object is not callable because max int object is not callable because max int object is not callable because max is now an integer it's not a function so is now an integer it's not a function so is now an integer it's not a function so we cannot call it we cannot call it we cannot call it so to solve this problem we can rename so to solve this problem we can rename so to solve this problem we can rename this variable to something else this variable to something else this variable to something else so right click here so right click here so right click here go to refactor go to refactor go to refactor and rename and rename and rename and rename this to maxi mum so you can see the warning is gone so you can see the warning is gone so you can see the warning is gone also we have the same warning in our also we have the same warning in our also we have the same warning in our utils module utils module utils module so here we're redefining max and as i so here we're redefining max and as i so here we're redefining max and as i told you before this is a bad practice told you before this is a bad practice told you before this is a bad practice we're changing the meaning of built-in we're changing the meaning of built-in we're changing the meaning of built-in functions in python so functions in python so functions in python so let's rename this as well i'm going to let's rename this as well i'm going to let's rename this as well i'm going to use the shortcut that is shift and f6 use the shortcut that is shift and f6 use the shortcut that is shift and f6 there you go there you go there you go and here we can change this to maximum and here we can change this to maximum and here we can change this to maximum enter done in this tutorial we're going to talk in this tutorial we're going to talk in this tutorial we're going to talk about packages in python packages are about packages in python packages are about packages in python packages are basically another way to organize our basically another way to organize our basically another way to organize our code so currently we have only three code so currently we have only three code so currently we have only three files or three modules in our project files or three modules in our project files or three modules in our project but a real project can contain hundreds but a real project can contain hundreds but a real project can contain hundreds or even thousands of modules we don't or even thousands of modules we don't or even thousands of modules we don't want to add all those modules here want to add all those modules here want to add all those modules here because over time this directory will because over time this directory will because over time this directory will get bloated with so many files so a get bloated with so many files so a get bloated with so many files so a better approach is to organize related better approach is to organize related better approach is to organize related modules inside of a package so a package modules inside of a package so a package modules inside of a package so a package is a container for multiple modules in is a container for multiple modules in is a container for multiple modules in file system terms a package is a file system terms a package is a file system terms a package is a directory or folder directory or folder directory or folder so in our project we can add a new so in our project we can add a new so in our project we can add a new directory and in that directory we can directory and in that directory we can directory and in that directory we can add all the related modules as a add all the related modules as a add all the related modules as a metaphor think of a mall when you go to metaphor think of a mall when you go to metaphor think of a mall when you go to a mall or a shopping center there are a mall or a shopping center there are a mall or a shopping center there are different sections for men's women's and different sections for men's women's and different sections for men's women's and kids clothing so that is like a package kids clothing so that is like a package kids clothing so that is like a package now when you go to the men's section now when you go to the men's section now when you go to the men's section there are different areas for different there are different areas for different there are different areas for different kinds of products we have a section for kinds of products we have a section for kinds of products we have a section for shoes t-shirts jackets and so on so each shoes t-shirts jackets and so on so each shoes t-shirts jackets and so on so each of these is like a module of these is like a module of these is like a module so in this tutorial i'm going to show so in this tutorial i'm going to show so in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to create and use packages in you how to create and use packages in you how to create and use packages in python python python here in our project panel right click here in our project panel right click here in our project panel right click the project and add a new directory the project and add a new directory the project and add a new directory let's call this directory let's call this directory let's call this directory e e e commerce commerce commerce so we're going to create a package so we're going to create a package so we're going to create a package called e-commerce and in this package called e-commerce and in this package called e-commerce and in this package we're going to have all the modules we're going to have all the modules we're going to have all the modules related for an e-commerce application related for an e-commerce application related for an e-commerce application for example we can have modules for for example we can have modules for for example we can have modules for sales shipping customer service and so sales shipping customer service and so sales shipping customer service and so on so let's go ahead on so let's go ahead on so let's go ahead now here we have an empty directory now here we have an empty directory now here we have an empty directory in order to convert this to a package we in order to convert this to a package we in order to convert this to a package we need to add a special file in it so need to add a special file in it so need to add a special file in it so right click this directory and add right click this directory and add right click this directory and add a new python file a new python file a new python file call that file double underscore in it call that file double underscore in it call that file double underscore in it double underscore double underscore double underscore this is a special convention in python this is a special convention in python this is a special convention in python when python interpreter sees when python interpreter sees when python interpreter sees a file with this name in a directory it a file with this name in a directory it a file with this name in a directory it treats this directory as a package we treats this directory as a package we treats this directory as a package we also have a shortcut for that in pycharm also have a shortcut for that in pycharm also have a shortcut for that in pycharm so let me delete this directory and so let me delete this directory and so let me delete this directory and start again start again start again so delete so delete so delete once again right click the project once again right click the project once again right click the project and go to new but instead of creating a and go to new but instead of creating a and go to new but instead of creating a new directory we can create a new python new directory we can create a new python new directory we can create a new python package package package let's call our package ecommerce let's call our package ecommerce let's call our package ecommerce as you can see pycharm automatically as you can see pycharm automatically as you can see pycharm automatically creates this file for us so we don't creates this file for us so we don't creates this file for us so we don't have to manually create it okay have to manually create it okay have to manually create it okay now in this package let's add a new now in this package let's add a new now in this package let's add a new module so a new python file module so a new python file module so a new python file let's call it shipping let's call it shipping let's call it shipping okay okay okay now in this module we want to add a now in this module we want to add a now in this module we want to add a function for calculating the shipping function for calculating the shipping function for calculating the shipping cost cost cost so define so define so define calculate underline shipping calculate underline shipping calculate underline shipping and don't worry about parameters or the and don't worry about parameters or the and don't worry about parameters or the implementation we simply print implementation we simply print implementation we simply print calculate underline shipping calculate underline shipping calculate underline shipping now let's say we want to import this now let's say we want to import this now let's say we want to import this shipping module into our app module shipping module into our app module shipping module into our app module with this new structure the shipping with this new structure the shipping with this new structure the shipping module is now part of the e-commerce module is now part of the e-commerce module is now part of the e-commerce package so we cannot import it directly package so we cannot import it directly package so we cannot import it directly we have to start from the e-commerce we have to start from the e-commerce we have to start from the e-commerce package okay package okay package okay so so so back to app.pipe once again there are back to app.pipe once again there are back to app.pipe once again there are two ways to import this module we can two ways to import this module we can two ways to import this module we can import the entire module or we can import the entire module or we can import the entire module or we can import one of its functions or classes import one of its functions or classes import one of its functions or classes so let me show you both approaches first so let me show you both approaches first so let me show you both approaches first we're going to import the entire module we're going to import the entire module we're going to import the entire module import import import now what is the name of our package that now what is the name of our package that now what is the name of our package that is e-commerce right so e-commerce dot is e-commerce right so e-commerce dot is e-commerce right so e-commerce dot shipping shipping shipping so instead of typing import shipping we so instead of typing import shipping we so instead of typing import shipping we type import e-commerce dot shipping we type import e-commerce dot shipping we type import e-commerce dot shipping we have to prefix it with the name of its have to prefix it with the name of its have to prefix it with the name of its package package package now to access any of the functions or now to access any of the functions or now to access any of the functions or classes in this module we'll have to classes in this module we'll have to classes in this module we'll have to type out ecommerce.shipping type out ecommerce.shipping type out ecommerce.shipping dot dot dot and there you go now we can access the and there you go now we can access the and there you go now we can access the calculate shipping function calculate shipping function calculate shipping function so let's go ahead and run our program so let's go ahead and run our program so let's go ahead and run our program we see this message printed on the we see this message printed on the we see this message printed on the terminal beautiful however with this terminal beautiful however with this terminal beautiful however with this approach every time you want to call one approach every time you want to call one approach every time you want to call one of the functions in this module we'll of the functions in this module we'll of the functions in this module we'll have to prefix it with e-commerce dot have to prefix it with e-commerce dot have to prefix it with e-commerce dot shipping dot that is very verbose so shipping dot that is very verbose so shipping dot that is very verbose so when working with packages we often use when working with packages we often use when working with packages we often use the second approach using the from the second approach using the from the second approach using the from statement statement statement so we can type from so we can type from so we can type from ecommerce.shipping ecommerce.shipping ecommerce.shipping import import import calculate shipping calculate shipping calculate shipping now we don't have to prefix this now we don't have to prefix this now we don't have to prefix this function with ecommerce.shipping function with ecommerce.shipping function with ecommerce.shipping and we can call it multiple times in and we can call it multiple times in and we can call it multiple times in this module so our code is a little bit this module so our code is a little bit this module so our code is a little bit shorter but what if you want to use shorter but what if you want to use shorter but what if you want to use multiple functions in the shipping multiple functions in the shipping multiple functions in the shipping module module module we can either import them all here so we can either import them all here so we can either import them all here so calculate shipping calculate shipping calculate shipping comma let's say calculate underline tags comma let's say calculate underline tags comma let's say calculate underline tags or we can import the entire module and or we can import the entire module and or we can import the entire module and then access all the functions or classes then access all the functions or classes then access all the functions or classes in that module in that module in that module so let me revert this back so let me revert this back so let me revert this back to import the entire module we type from to import the entire module we type from to import the entire module we type from e-commerce so we remove dot shipping e-commerce so we remove dot shipping e-commerce so we remove dot shipping so from this package import so from this package import so from this package import the shipping the shipping the shipping module module module now this shipping module is an object now this shipping module is an object now this shipping module is an object so we can access so we can access so we can access all the functions and classes defined all the functions and classes defined all the functions and classes defined here using the dot operator so shipping here using the dot operator so shipping here using the dot operator so shipping dot there you go calculate shipping dot there you go calculate shipping dot there you go calculate shipping so to recap when using the from so to recap when using the from so to recap when using the from statement we can either start from the statement we can either start from the statement we can either start from the package and import a specific module package and import a specific module package and import a specific module or we can start from package dot or we can start from package dot or we can start from package dot module and then import a specific module and then import a specific module and then import a specific function function function like calculate shipping like calculate shipping like calculate shipping so this was the basics of using packages so this was the basics of using packages so this was the basics of using packages in python as i told you before packages in python as i told you before packages in python as i told you before packages are extremely important especially when are extremely important especially when are extremely important especially when you want to work with a framework like you want to work with a framework like you want to work with a framework like django we use django for building web django we use django for building web django we use django for building web applications with python and i'm going applications with python and i'm going applications with python and i'm going to show you that later in this course to show you that later in this course to show you that later in this course so in django we have quite a few so in django we have quite a few so in django we have quite a few packages and each package contains packages and each package contains packages and each package contains several modules so make sure to watch several modules so make sure to watch several modules so make sure to watch the tutorials about modules and packages the tutorials about modules and packages the tutorials about modules and packages one more time otherwise you're going to one more time otherwise you're going to one more time otherwise you're going to get confused later when we get to django in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about the built-in modules in you guys about the built-in modules in you guys about the built-in modules in python so python comes with a standard python so python comes with a standard python so python comes with a standard library that contains several modules library that contains several modules library that contains several modules for common tasks such as sending emails for common tasks such as sending emails for common tasks such as sending emails working with data and time generating working with data and time generating working with data and time generating random values and passwords and so on random values and passwords and so on random values and passwords and so on there are so many modules already built there are so many modules already built there are so many modules already built into python and that means there is into python and that means there is into python and that means there is already lots of functionality that we already lots of functionality that we already lots of functionality that we can reuse we don't have to code all of can reuse we don't have to code all of can reuse we don't have to code all of that from scratch let me show you where that from scratch let me show you where that from scratch let me show you where you can find the standard library so you can find the standard library so you can find the standard library so open up your browser and search for open up your browser and search for open up your browser and search for python 3 module index python 3 module index python 3 module index make sure to add the version number make sure to add the version number make sure to add the version number because the modules in python 2 are because the modules in python 2 are because the modules in python 2 are different from modules in python 3. so different from modules in python 3. so different from modules in python 3. so here we search for python 3 module index here we search for python 3 module index here we search for python 3 module index and the first page here you can see it's and the first page here you can see it's and the first page here you can see it's python module index for python 3. python module index for python 3. python module index for python 3. let's go ahead so these are all the let's go ahead so these are all the let's go ahead so these are all the modules modules modules built into python for example we have built into python for example we have built into python for example we have modules for working with data and time modules for working with data and time modules for working with data and time we have modules for sending emails for we have modules for sending emails for we have modules for sending emails for encoding values there are so many encoding values there are so many encoding values there are so many modules here now the explanation of all modules here now the explanation of all modules here now the explanation of all this is beyond the scope of this course this is beyond the scope of this course this is beyond the scope of this course that really requires its own course that really requires its own course that really requires its own course because we have so many modules here but because we have so many modules here but because we have so many modules here but don't let this list intimidate you this don't let this list intimidate you this don't let this list intimidate you this is not something that you need to learn is not something that you need to learn is not something that you need to learn right now as you work with python as you right now as you work with python as you right now as you work with python as you build more applications gradually you'll build more applications gradually you'll build more applications gradually you'll get more familiar with various modules get more familiar with various modules get more familiar with various modules here in fact nobody knows all the here in fact nobody knows all the here in fact nobody knows all the modules in python standard library modules in python standard library modules in python standard library everybody knows some modules based on everybody knows some modules based on everybody knows some modules based on the applications they have built the applications they have built the applications they have built so in this tutorial i'm going to show so in this tutorial i'm going to show so in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to use one of the built-in you how to use one of the built-in you how to use one of the built-in modules for generating random values so modules for generating random values so modules for generating random values so on the top we import on the top we import on the top we import the random the random the random module module module now because random is a built-in module now because random is a built-in module now because random is a built-in module we don't need to have a file here called we don't need to have a file here called we don't need to have a file here called so python interpreter knows that random so python interpreter knows that random so python interpreter knows that random is a built-in module and it knows where is a built-in module and it knows where is a built-in module and it knows where to find it now if you're curious where to find it now if you're curious where to find it now if you're curious where this random module is stored on the disk this random module is stored on the disk this random module is stored on the disk let me show you so here in the project let me show you so here in the project let me show you so here in the project panel panel panel expand external libraries expand external libraries expand external libraries then expand python 3 then expand python 3 then expand python 3 and then one more time python 3.7 and then one more time python 3.7 and then one more time python 3.7 library root library root library root so this is a folder somewhere on your so this is a folder somewhere on your so this is a folder somewhere on your computer in this folder we have all the computer in this folder we have all the computer in this folder we have all the built-in modules in python so if you built-in modules in python so if you built-in modules in python so if you scroll down scroll down scroll down you should be able to find you should be able to find you should be able to find the random module there you go it's the random module there you go it's the random module there you go it's right here it's a random.pi you can open right here it's a random.pi you can open right here it's a random.pi you can open this this this and and and this shows you the source code of this this shows you the source code of this this shows you the source code of this module there you go module there you go module there you go now in this tutorial we don't want to now in this tutorial we don't want to now in this tutorial we don't want to worry about that so let's go back to our worry about that so let's go back to our worry about that so let's go back to our app.pi and use this module to generate app.pi and use this module to generate app.pi and use this module to generate random values random values random values so when we import this module now we so when we import this module now we so when we import this module now we have this object random so we can use have this object random so we can use have this object random so we can use the dot operator to access its methods the dot operator to access its methods the dot operator to access its methods one method that is very useful here is one method that is very useful here is one method that is very useful here is the random method and every time we call the random method and every time we call the random method and every time we call it it generates a random value between 0 it it generates a random value between 0 it it generates a random value between 0 to 1. to 1. to 1. so here we can do a for loop so here we can do a for loop so here we can do a for loop let's say four let's say four let's say four i i i in in in range three so just to refresh our range three so just to refresh our range three so just to refresh our memory we are using the range function memory we are using the range function memory we are using the range function to create a range object we can loop to create a range object we can loop to create a range object we can loop through this range object and in each through this range object and in each through this range object and in each iteration this object will spit out a iteration this object will spit out a iteration this object will spit out a value value value so with this for loop we can execute so with this for loop we can execute so with this for loop we can execute this code three times now let's indent this code three times now let's indent this code three times now let's indent this okay and finally let's print the this okay and finally let's print the this okay and finally let's print the result there you go so we can see that in each there you go so we can see that in each there you go so we can see that in each iteration we get a new random value iteration we get a new random value iteration we get a new random value between 0 to 1. now what if we want a between 0 to 1. now what if we want a between 0 to 1. now what if we want a random value for a particular age let's random value for a particular age let's random value for a particular age let's say random values between 10 to 20. well say random values between 10 to 20. well say random values between 10 to 20. well there is another method here around and there is another method here around and there is another method here around and we passed two arguments here to specify we passed two arguments here to specify we passed two arguments here to specify our range let's say 10 and 20. our range let's say 10 and 20. our range let's say 10 and 20. run our program one more time run our program one more time run our program one more time now we have the numbers 20 13 and 18. if now we have the numbers 20 13 and 18. if now we have the numbers 20 13 and 18. if we run our program one more time we get we run our program one more time we get we run our program one more time we get different values so 20 19 11 one more different values so 20 19 11 one more different values so 20 19 11 one more time time time look look look we also have another powerful method for we also have another powerful method for we also have another powerful method for randomly picking an item from a list randomly picking an item from a list randomly picking an item from a list let's say we have a list of team members let's say we have a list of team members let's say we have a list of team members and we want to randomly pick someone as and we want to randomly pick someone as and we want to randomly pick someone as the leader let me show you how to do the leader let me show you how to do the leader let me show you how to do that so we define the list of team that so we define the list of team that so we define the list of team members members members we set it to we set it to we set it to john john john mary mary mary bob bob bob and marsh and marsh and marsh now now now we can call random the choice we can call random the choice we can call random the choice and pass and pass and pass our members list our members list our members list this method randomly picks an item from this method randomly picks an item from this method randomly picks an item from this list and returns it so we can store this list and returns it so we can store this list and returns it so we can store the result in leader and then print it the result in leader and then print it the result in leader and then print it on the terminal on the terminal on the terminal let's run our program let's run our program let's run our program so now the leader is merry if we run our so now the leader is merry if we run our so now the leader is merry if we run our program one more time this time it's program one more time this time it's program one more time this time it's mosh now it's march again one more time mosh now it's march again one more time mosh now it's march again one more time it really likes much it really likes much it really likes much now it's bob you got the point so the now it's bob you got the point so the now it's bob you got the point so the random module is very powerful and it random module is very powerful and it random module is very powerful and it has a lot of applications has a lot of applications has a lot of applications now here's a very cool exercise i wanted now here's a very cool exercise i wanted now here's a very cool exercise i wanted to write this program to roll a dice so to write this program to roll a dice so to write this program to roll a dice so every time we run this program we get every time we run this program we get every time we run this program we get different values now we have three and different values now we have three and different values now we have three and one next time we get three and six one one next time we get three and six one one next time we get three and six one more time five and six four and three more time five and six four and three more time five and six four and three double one that's a very cool exercise double one that's a very cool exercise double one that's a very cool exercise so before we get started i want you to so before we get started i want you to so before we get started i want you to pay attention to a few things pay attention to a few things pay attention to a few things i want you to define a class called dice i want you to define a class called dice i want you to define a class called dice in this class we're going to have a in this class we're going to have a in this class we're going to have a method called roll method called roll method called roll so every time we call this method we get so every time we call this method we get so every time we call this method we get a tuple a tuple remember is a list of a tuple a tuple remember is a list of a tuple a tuple remember is a list of values but that list cannot be changed values but that list cannot be changed values but that list cannot be changed we cannot add a new item to it we cannot we cannot add a new item to it we cannot we cannot add a new item to it we cannot remove it so it's like a read-only list remove it so it's like a read-only list remove it so it's like a read-only list so every time we call the roll method we so every time we call the roll method we so every time we call the roll method we should get a tuple of two random values should get a tuple of two random values should get a tuple of two random values so go ahead and do this exercise you'll so go ahead and do this exercise you'll so go ahead and do this exercise you'll see my solution next all right we start by importing the all right we start by importing the all right we start by importing the random module on the top random module on the top random module on the top then we define a class called dice then we define a class called dice then we define a class called dice colon in this class we want to have a colon in this class we want to have a colon in this class we want to have a method called role so define role method called role so define role method called role so define role parenthesis this automatically adds self parenthesis this automatically adds self parenthesis this automatically adds self now in this method we want to generate now in this method we want to generate now in this method we want to generate two random values between one to six so two random values between one to six so two random values between one to six so we call we call we call random random random dot rand int dot rand int dot rand int and pass one and six so this generates and pass one and six so this generates and pass one and six so this generates the first number the first number the first number we can put that here we can put that here we can put that here now let's call this one more time so i'm now let's call this one more time so i'm now let's call this one more time so i'm going to copy what we have on line five going to copy what we have on line five going to copy what we have on line five put it here and change this variable to put it here and change this variable to put it here and change this variable to second second second so we have two variables first and so we have two variables first and so we have two variables first and second with two random values finally we second with two random values finally we second with two random values finally we need to return them in a tuple so return need to return them in a tuple so return need to return them in a tuple so return parenthesis instead of square brackets parenthesis instead of square brackets parenthesis instead of square brackets first and second first and second first and second now in python when you want to return a now in python when you want to return a now in python when you want to return a tuple from a function you don't have to tuple from a function you don't have to tuple from a function you don't have to add this parenthesis so you can simplify add this parenthesis so you can simplify add this parenthesis so you can simplify your code and python will automatically your code and python will automatically your code and python will automatically interpret this as a tuple okay interpret this as a tuple okay interpret this as a tuple okay so we're done with the definition of our so we're done with the definition of our so we're done with the definition of our class we remove the indentation and add class we remove the indentation and add class we remove the indentation and add two line breaks now we create an object two line breaks now we create an object two line breaks now we create an object of this type so of this type so of this type so we set dice to dice we set dice to dice we set dice to dice next we roll the dice so dice.roll and next we roll the dice so dice.roll and next we roll the dice so dice.roll and print the result on the terminal print the result on the terminal print the result on the terminal that's all you have to do let's run this that's all you have to do let's run this that's all you have to do let's run this program program program so now we get two and five let's run it so now we get two and five let's run it so now we get two and five let's run it one more time three and two one on one one more time three and two one on one one more time three and two one on one beautiful beautiful beautiful now we have this little warning here now we have this little warning here now we have this little warning here that says expected to black lines found that says expected to black lines found that says expected to black lines found one once again this is coming from pep8 one once again this is coming from pep8 one once again this is coming from pep8 pep is short for python enhancement pep is short for python enhancement pep is short for python enhancement proposal we have so many python proposal we have so many python proposal we have so many python enhancement proposals or peps pep8 is a enhancement proposals or peps pep8 is a enhancement proposals or peps pep8 is a very famous one and in this document we very famous one and in this document we very famous one and in this document we have have have all the best practices for formatting all the best practices for formatting all the best practices for formatting our code so pep8 says that after we our code so pep8 says that after we our code so pep8 says that after we define our classes we should have two define our classes we should have two define our classes we should have two line breaks we already done that so the line breaks we already done that so the line breaks we already done that so the reason this is complaining is because we reason this is complaining is because we reason this is complaining is because we have one line break before the class so have one line break before the class so have one line break before the class so let's add one more line break now pie let's add one more line break now pie let's add one more line break now pie charm is happy so basically pycharm is charm is happy so basically pycharm is charm is happy so basically pycharm is following all the best practices defined following all the best practices defined following all the best practices defined in pep 8. in pep 8. in pep 8. now you don't have to memorize any of now you don't have to memorize any of now you don't have to memorize any of these best practices as you code in these best practices as you code in these best practices as you code in pycharm pycharm gives you little pycharm pycharm gives you little pycharm pycharm gives you little warnings and gradually you will learn warnings and gradually you will learn warnings and gradually you will learn how to properly format your code so it's how to properly format your code so it's how to properly format your code so it's readable by other people in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to work with directories in python how to work with directories in python how to work with directories in python so here on python 3 module index you can so here on python 3 module index you can so here on python 3 module index you can see we have a module called pathlib see we have a module called pathlib see we have a module called pathlib which provides an object oriented file which provides an object oriented file which provides an object oriented file system patch that basically means it system patch that basically means it system patch that basically means it provides classes that we can use to provides classes that we can use to provides classes that we can use to create objects to work with directories create objects to work with directories create objects to work with directories and files so if you click here you can and files so if you click here you can and files so if you click here you can see how this module works you can see see how this module works you can see see how this module works you can see all kinds of examples for example here all kinds of examples for example here all kinds of examples for example here under basic usage you can see this is under basic usage you can see this is under basic usage you can see this is how we import the past class from the how we import the past class from the how we import the past class from the passlip module let me zoom in so you can passlip module let me zoom in so you can passlip module let me zoom in so you can see clearly okay so look from passlip see clearly okay so look from passlip see clearly okay so look from passlip that's our module import path note the that's our module import path note the that's our module import path note the naming convention p is capitalized that naming convention p is capitalized that naming convention p is capitalized that means path is a class means path is a class means path is a class so we need to create an instance of this so we need to create an instance of this so we need to create an instance of this class as you can see class as you can see class as you can see right here right here right here now there is so much documentation here now there is so much documentation here now there is so much documentation here you can read this on your own but let me you can read this on your own but let me you can read this on your own but let me quickly show you a few examples to help quickly show you a few examples to help quickly show you a few examples to help you get started you get started you get started so back in pycharm so back in pycharm so back in pycharm on the top on the top on the top from the passlip module let's import the from the passlip module let's import the from the passlip module let's import the past class past class past class now we need to create a path object to now we need to create a path object to now we need to create a path object to reference a file or a directory on our reference a file or a directory on our reference a file or a directory on our computer computer computer so there are basically two ways to do so there are basically two ways to do so there are basically two ways to do this we can use an absolute pass this we can use an absolute pass this we can use an absolute pass or a relative path which basically means or a relative path which basically means or a relative path which basically means a path starting from the current a path starting from the current a path starting from the current directory for example if you want to directory for example if you want to directory for example if you want to reference reference reference this ecommerce directory in our project this ecommerce directory in our project this ecommerce directory in our project we can use the relative path so we start we can use the relative path so we start we can use the relative path so we start from the current directory and then go from the current directory and then go from the current directory and then go somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else with absolute paths we start from the with absolute paths we start from the with absolute paths we start from the root of our hard disk root of our hard disk root of our hard disk for example if you're on windows you for example if you're on windows you for example if you're on windows you might have an absolute path like this c might have an absolute path like this c might have an absolute path like this c drive backslash program drive backslash program drive backslash program files files files backslash microsoft so these are backslash microsoft so these are backslash microsoft so these are directories directories directories in c drive on windows we use a backslash in c drive on windows we use a backslash in c drive on windows we use a backslash to build a path to build a path to build a path if you're on mac or linux your paths if you're on mac or linux your paths if you're on mac or linux your paths look a little bit different so instead look a little bit different so instead look a little bit different so instead of a backslash we have a forward slash of a backslash we have a forward slash of a backslash we have a forward slash let's say user let's say user let's say user local slash bin local slash bin local slash bin so these are examples of absolute paths so these are examples of absolute paths so these are examples of absolute paths in this tutorial we're going to work in this tutorial we're going to work in this tutorial we're going to work with a relative pass to work with this with a relative pass to work with this with a relative pass to work with this ecommerce directory that we have in our ecommerce directory that we have in our ecommerce directory that we have in our project now if you didn't create this project now if you didn't create this project now if you didn't create this directory earlier simply right click on directory earlier simply right click on directory earlier simply right click on the project and then go to new the project and then go to new the project and then go to new directory directory directory okay okay okay so so so let's close this panel let's close this panel let's close this panel we create a path object we create a path object we create a path object now if we don't pass an argument here now if we don't pass an argument here now if we don't pass an argument here this will reference the current this will reference the current this will reference the current directory directory directory alternatively we can pass a string in alternatively we can pass a string in alternatively we can pass a string in this string we can add a file or a this string we can add a file or a this string we can add a file or a directory let's say the e-commerce directory let's say the e-commerce directory let's say the e-commerce directory directory directory now this returns a pass object so you now this returns a pass object so you now this returns a pass object so you store it here store it here store it here now this pass object has a few now this pass object has a few now this pass object has a few interesting methods for example we can interesting methods for example we can interesting methods for example we can check to see if a path exists by calling check to see if a path exists by calling check to see if a path exists by calling the exist method this simply returns a the exist method this simply returns a the exist method this simply returns a boolean so let's print it on the boolean so let's print it on the boolean so let's print it on the terminal terminal terminal there you go there you go there you go so this path exists but if we change so this path exists but if we change so this path exists but if we change this to let's say e-commerce 1 and run this to let's say e-commerce 1 and run this to let's say e-commerce 1 and run our program we get false our program we get false our program we get false we can also create a new directory for we can also create a new directory for we can also create a new directory for example let's change this path to emails example let's change this path to emails example let's change this path to emails now when we run this program obviously now when we run this program obviously now when we run this program obviously we don't have this directory but we can we don't have this directory but we can we don't have this directory but we can create it by calling the mkdir create it by calling the mkdir create it by calling the mkdir method so make directory method so make directory method so make directory let's run our program let's run our program let's run our program all right this method returns none which all right this method returns none which all right this method returns none which basically means it doesn't return any basically means it doesn't return any basically means it doesn't return any values now if you look at the project values now if you look at the project values now if you look at the project panel you can see here we have a new panel you can see here we have a new panel you can see here we have a new directory called emails we can also directory called emails we can also directory called emails we can also delete this directory so delete this directory so delete this directory so instead of mkdir we call rm dir which is instead of mkdir we call rm dir which is instead of mkdir we call rm dir which is short for remove directory short for remove directory short for remove directory let's go ahead let's go ahead let's go ahead now you can see that directory is gone now you can see that directory is gone now you can see that directory is gone we can also find all the files and we can also find all the files and we can also find all the files and directories in a given pass that is very directories in a given pass that is very directories in a given pass that is very useful if you want to write a little useful if you want to write a little useful if you want to write a little program to automate something for program to automate something for program to automate something for example you can iterate over all the example you can iterate over all the example you can iterate over all the spreadsheets in a directory open them spreadsheets in a directory open them spreadsheets in a directory open them and process them and process them and process them let me show you so first we change the let me show you so first we change the let me show you so first we change the path path path to the current directory to the current directory to the current directory and then we call the glob method and then we call the glob method and then we call the glob method with this method we can search for files with this method we can search for files with this method we can search for files and directories in the current path so and directories in the current path so and directories in the current path so as the first argument we need to pass a as the first argument we need to pass a as the first argument we need to pass a string that defines a search pattern we string that defines a search pattern we string that defines a search pattern we can type an asterisk and that means can type an asterisk and that means can type an asterisk and that means everything all files and all directories everything all files and all directories everything all files and all directories we can optionally add an extension we can optionally add an extension we can optionally add an extension so to get all the files we use star dot so to get all the files we use star dot so to get all the files we use star dot star star star with this pattern we'll only get the with this pattern we'll only get the with this pattern we'll only get the files in the current directory but not files in the current directory but not files in the current directory but not the directories we can also search for the directories we can also search for the directories we can also search for all the pi files or all the excel all the pi files or all the excel all the pi files or all the excel spreadsheets anything spreadsheets anything spreadsheets anything so let's search for all the pi files and so let's search for all the pi files and so let's search for all the pi files and the current directory the current directory the current directory now when we run our program now when we run our program now when we run our program we get this generator object generator we get this generator object generator we get this generator object generator objects are kind of an advanced topic objects are kind of an advanced topic objects are kind of an advanced topic and they are beyond the scope of this and they are beyond the scope of this and they are beyond the scope of this beginner's python course but for now all beginner's python course but for now all beginner's python course but for now all you need to know is that we can iterate you need to know is that we can iterate you need to know is that we can iterate or loop through these generator objects or loop through these generator objects or loop through these generator objects so so so instead of printing this generator instead of printing this generator instead of printing this generator object let's just object let's just object let's just iterate over it using a for loop so iterate over it using a for loop so iterate over it using a for loop so for for for file in file in file in the generator object that is returned the generator object that is returned the generator object that is returned from the glob method from the glob method from the glob method let's print let's print let's print file file file run our program there you go run our program there you go run our program there you go so these are all the pi files in my so these are all the pi files in my so these are all the pi files in my current directory this could be current directory this could be current directory this could be different on your machine if you didn't different on your machine if you didn't different on your machine if you didn't follow the exercises i gave you earlier follow the exercises i gave you earlier follow the exercises i gave you earlier for example this utils.pi we created for example this utils.pi we created for example this utils.pi we created this as part of one of the exercises this as part of one of the exercises this as part of one of the exercises earlier in this course so don't worry if earlier in this course so don't worry if earlier in this course so don't worry if the files you see here are different on the files you see here are different on the files you see here are different on your machine your machine your machine so we can use the glob method to search so we can use the glob method to search so we can use the glob method to search for files using a pattern we can also for files using a pattern we can also for files using a pattern we can also get all the files and directories in the get all the files and directories in the get all the files and directories in the current path current path current path so we just use one asterisk so we just use one asterisk so we just use one asterisk run our program take a look run our program take a look run our program take a look so we have this ecommerce directory we so we have this ecommerce directory we so we have this ecommerce directory we have notes.txt have notes.txt have notes.txt this is a file i added earlier just to this is a file i added earlier just to this is a file i added earlier just to write notes as part of my presentation write notes as part of my presentation write notes as part of my presentation so you're not going to have this file so you're not going to have this file so you're not going to have this file you also have a bunch of other you also have a bunch of other you also have a bunch of other directories and files even though python's standard library is even though python's standard library is even though python's standard library is very comprehensive and has so many very comprehensive and has so many very comprehensive and has so many modules for common tasks it's not modules for common tasks it's not modules for common tasks it's not complete by any means that's why we have complete by any means that's why we have complete by any means that's why we have this directory called python package this directory called python package this directory called python package index or pypi and in this directory you index or pypi and in this directory you index or pypi and in this directory you can find thousands of packages for doing can find thousands of packages for doing can find thousands of packages for doing awesome things these are the packages awesome things these are the packages awesome things these are the packages that people like you and i have built as that people like you and i have built as that people like you and i have built as part of their projects and then they part of their projects and then they part of their projects and then they published it in this directory for other published it in this directory for other published it in this directory for other people to use so that's why we have a people to use so that's why we have a people to use so that's why we have a fantastic community in python there are fantastic community in python there are fantastic community in python there are so many python developers out there and so many python developers out there and so many python

expand external libraries expand external libraries expand external libraries next expand python3 next expand python3 next expand python3 and then expand site packages this is and then expand site packages this is and then expand site packages this is where all these packages that we where all these packages that we where all these packages that we installed with pip are stored so here we installed with pip are stored so here we installed with pip are stored so here we have open pi excel you can open this have open pi excel you can open this have open pi excel you can open this in this folder we have another folder in this folder we have another folder in this folder we have another folder called cell called cell called cell now look what we have here we have this now look what we have here we have this now look what we have here we have this init pi area i told you that whenever we init pi area i told you that whenever we init pi area i told you that whenever we add this file to a folder python treats add this file to a folder python treats add this file to a folder python treats that folder as a package so cell is a that folder as a package so cell is a that folder as a package so cell is a package and in this package we have package and in this package we have package and in this package we have these modules cell interface read-only these modules cell interface

going to work on our first next we're going to work on our first python project that involves automation python project that involves automation python project that involves automation you're going to write a python program you're going to write a python program you're going to write a python program that can process thousands of that can process thousands of that can process thousands of spreadsheets in under a second are you spreadsheets in under a second are you spreadsheets in under a second are you excited let's get started in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you something really awesome you can do with something really awesome you can do with something really awesome you can do with python you're going to learn how to python you're going to learn how to python you're going to learn how to process spreadsheets and this is process spreadsheets and this is process spreadsheets and this is extremely valuable in situations where extremely valuable in situations where extremely valuable in situations where you have hundreds or thousands of you have hundreds or thousands of you have hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets that need to be updated if spreadsheets that need to be updated if spreadsheets that need to be updated if you want to do this by hand it may take you want to do this by hand it may take you want to do this by hand it may take hours days weeks or even months you can hours days weeks or even months you can hours days weeks or even months you can simply build a python program in less simply build a python program in less simply build a python program in less than half an hour and have that python than half an hour and have that python than half an hour and have that python program automatically process thousands program automatically process thousands program automatically process thousands of spreadsheets in under one second of spreadsheets in under one second of spreadsheets in under one second so here we're going to work on this so here we're going to work on this so here we're going to work on this excel spreadsheet you can download this excel spreadsheet you can download this excel spreadsheet you can download this below this video in this spreadsheet we below this video in this spreadsheet we below this video in this spreadsheet we have three columns transaction id have three columns transaction id have three columns transaction id product id and price product id and price product id and price now don't worry about the fourth column now don't worry about the fourth column now don't worry about the fourth column yet so in a spreadsheet we record all yet so in a spreadsheet we record all yet so in a spreadsheet we record all kinds of transactions but let's say due kinds of transactions but let's say due kinds of transactions but let's say due to an error it could be a human error or to an error it could be a human error or to an error it could be a human error or a system error the price that we have a system error the price that we have a system error the price that we have here is wrong let's say we need to here is wrong let's say we need to here is wrong let's say we need to decrease this by 10 percent if you want decrease this by 10 percent if you want decrease this by 10 percent if you want to do this manually we'll have to come to do this manually we'll have to come to do this manually we'll have to come back here back here back here and add a formula so we type out equal and add a formula so we type out equal and add a formula so we type out equal sign let's say we want to recalculate sign let's say we want to recalculate sign let's say we want to recalculate the value of this cell that is c2 so the value of this cell that is c2 so the value of this cell that is c2 so we'll have to get that and then multiply we'll have to get that and then multiply we'll have to get that and then multiply it by it by it by 0.9 so that is like the 90 0.9 so that is like the 90 0.9 so that is like the 90 of the original price we are reducing of the original price we are reducing of the original price we are reducing the price by 10 the price by 10 the price by 10 now when we hit enter you can see the now when we hit enter you can see the now when we hit enter you can see the updated price updated price updated price next we'll have to come back here select next we'll have to come back here select next we'll have to come back here select the cell and then apply the same formula the cell and then apply the same formula the cell and then apply the same formula to all the other rows now what if we to all the other rows now what if we to all the other rows now what if we have thousands of rows here we'll have have thousands of rows here we'll have have thousands of rows here we'll have to scroll up and down this is going to to scroll up and down this is going to to scroll up and down this is going to be very tedious so we're going to write be very tedious so we're going to write be very tedious so we're going to write a python program that will do this for a python program that will do this for a python program that will do this for us it's going to automate this process us it's going to automate this process us it's going to automate this process and not only that it will also and not only that it will also and not only that it will also add this beautiful add this beautiful add this beautiful chart chart chart right here right here right here once again if you want to open up once again if you want to open up once again if you want to open up hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets and add a chart to each one this is and add a chart to each one this is and add a chart to each one this is going to take at least a week or two our going to take at least a week or two our going to take at least a week or two our python program is going to do all of python program is going to do all of python program is going to do all of this in a matter of seconds so let's get this in a matter of seconds so let's get this in a matter of seconds so let's get started started started all right the first thing i want you to all right the first thing i want you to all right the first thing i want you to do is to download this transactions file do is to download this transactions file do is to download this transactions file and add it to your project i'll put the and add it to your project i'll put the and add it to your project i'll put the link below this video for you to link below this video for you to link below this video for you to download download download so if you're wondering how to put this so if you're wondering how to put this so if you're wondering how to put this in this project you can simply right in this project you can simply right in this project you can simply right click the project click the project click the project and and and if you're on mac you have this item if you're on mac you have this item if you're on mac you have this item reveal in finder if you're on windows reveal in finder if you're on windows reveal in finder if you're on windows you should see something like reveal in you should see something like reveal in you should see something like reveal in explorer or file explorer or windows explorer or file explorer or windows explorer or file explorer or windows explorer whatever it's called when you explorer whatever it's called when you explorer whatever it's called when you click this click this click this this opens up the directory on your this opens up the directory on your this opens up the directory on your machine where this project is stored so machine where this project is stored so machine where this project is stored so you can simply copy and paste the you can simply copy and paste the you can simply copy and paste the transactions file right here transactions file right here transactions file right here now here on the top first we need to now here on the top first we need to now here on the top first we need to import the open pi excel package so import the open pi excel package so import the open pi excel package so import open pi excel we can give it an import open pi excel we can give it an import open pi excel we can give it an alias to make our code shorter so as alias to make our code shorter so as alias to make our code shorter so as excel this is not required but it just excel this is not required but it just excel this is not required but it just makes our code a little bit cleaner let makes our code a little bit cleaner let makes our code a little bit cleaner let me show you so now instead of typing me show you so now instead of typing me show you so now instead of typing open pi excel dot open pi excel dot open pi excel dot we type x l dot okay so that's an alias we type x l dot okay so that's an alias we type x l dot okay so that's an alias for this package for this package for this package now in this package we have a function now in this package we have a function now in this package we have a function for loading an excel workbook so let's for loading an excel workbook so let's for loading an excel workbook so let's call load workbook call load workbook call load workbook and and and as the argument we pass transactions dot as the argument we pass transactions dot as the argument we pass transactions dot xlsx xlsx xlsx so this will load our excel workbook and so this will load our excel workbook and so this will load our excel workbook and return a workbook object return a workbook object return a workbook object okay okay okay now if you open this workbook you can now if you open this workbook you can now if you open this workbook you can see you have only one sheet and that is see you have only one sheet and that is see you have only one sheet and that is called sheet one so to access that we called sheet one so to access that we called sheet one so to access that we use square brackets use square brackets use square brackets and specify the name of the sheet that and specify the name of the sheet that and specify the name of the sheet that is sheet one make sure to spell this is sheet one make sure to spell this is sheet one make sure to spell this with a capital s because this is case with a capital s because this is case with a capital s because this is case sensitive if you don't split it properly sensitive if you don't split it properly sensitive if you don't split it properly you're going to get an error you're going to get an error you're going to get an error so this returns so this returns so this returns our first sheet our first sheet our first sheet now in this sheet we have various cells now in this sheet we have various cells now in this sheet we have various cells so next you need to learn how to access so next you need to learn how to access so next you need to learn how to access a particular cell and that is very easy a particular cell and that is very easy a particular cell and that is very easy back to pycharm back to pycharm back to pycharm with this sheet object we can use square with this sheet object we can use square with this sheet object we can use square brackets and give the coordinate of a brackets and give the coordinate of a brackets and give the coordinate of a cell cell cell the coordinate is the combination of the the coordinate is the combination of the the coordinate is the combination of the column and the row for example this cell column and the row for example this cell column and the row for example this cell its coordinate is a one its coordinate is a one its coordinate is a one so back to pycharm here we can type a1 so back to pycharm here we can type a1 so back to pycharm here we can type a1 and this returns and this returns and this returns our first cell our first cell our first cell there is also another approach to get a there is also another approach to get a there is also another approach to get a cell instead of using square brackets cell instead of using square brackets cell instead of using square brackets with a string with a string with a string we can use we can use we can use the cell method of the sheet object so the cell method of the sheet object so the cell method of the sheet object so sheet that cell we pass the row and the sheet that cell we pass the row and the sheet that cell we pass the row and the column so row one and column one column so row one and column one column so row one and column one this returns the exact same cell this returns the exact same cell this returns the exact same cell now let's print the value of the cell so now let's print the value of the cell so now let's print the value of the cell so cell that value cell that value cell that value and run our program and run our program and run our program so the value is transaction id beautiful so the value is transaction id beautiful so the value is transaction id beautiful so now we need to iterate over all these so now we need to iterate over all these so now we need to iterate over all these rows and for each row we need to get the rows and for each row we need to get the rows and for each row we need to get the value in the third column that is the value in the third column that is the value in the third column that is the price we'll get that and then multiply price we'll get that and then multiply price we'll get that and then multiply it by 0.9 it by 0.9 it by 0.9 so first we need to know how many rows so first we need to know how many rows so first we need to know how many rows we have in this spreadsheet we can get we have in this spreadsheet we can get we have in this spreadsheet we can get that from the sheet object so sheet that from the sheet object so sheet that from the sheet object so sheet has has has an attribute called max underline row an attribute called max underline row an attribute called max underline row let's print this let's print this let's print this so in this sheet we have four rows so in this sheet we have four rows so in this sheet we have four rows and you can verify that here so we have and you can verify that here so we have and you can verify that here so we have a total of four rows a total of four rows a total of four rows so we need to add a for loop that would so we need to add a for loop that would so we need to add a for loop that would generate the numbers one to four so generate the numbers one to four so generate the numbers one to four so let's delete this print statement let's delete this print statement let's delete this print statement and add a for loop for row in we're and add a for loop for row in we're and add a for loop for row in we're going to use the range function to going to use the range function to going to use the range function to generate a range of numbers generate a range of numbers generate a range of numbers starting from 1 starting from 1 starting from 1 all the way to sheet dot max underline all the way to sheet dot max underline all the way to sheet dot max underline row row row plus one the reason we're adding one to plus one the reason we're adding one to plus one the reason we're adding one to this is because as i told you before this is because as i told you before this is because as i told you before this range function would generate this range function would generate this range function would generate numbers starting from this value all the numbers starting from this value all the numbers starting from this value all the way to this value but it will not way to this value but it will not way to this value but it will not include the second value so currently include the second value so currently include the second value so currently max row returns four if we use range of max row returns four if we use range of max row returns four if we use range of one to four this would generate the one to four this would generate the one to four this would generate the numbers one two and three but not four numbers one two and three but not four numbers one two and three but not four so to include four we need to add one to so to include four we need to add one to so to include four we need to add one to it it it let's go back here let's go back here let's go back here so we type sheet.max underline row plus so we type sheet.max underline row plus so we type sheet.max underline row plus 1. 1. 1. now before going any further let's just now before going any further let's just now before going any further let's just print row and make sure our program is print row and make sure our program is print row and make sure our program is working up to this point working up to this point working up to this point so so so let's run this we get the numbers one to let's run this we get the numbers one to let's run this we get the numbers one to four beautiful so now we can easily get four beautiful so now we can easily get four beautiful so now we can easily get the cells in the third column however we the cells in the third column however we the cells in the third column however we don't really want this first cell that's don't really want this first cell that's don't really want this first cell that's the heading so technically we want to the heading so technically we want to the heading so technically we want to ignore the first row ignore the first row ignore the first row back here we want to change our range back here we want to change our range back here we want to change our range function and start from two function and start from two function and start from two okay okay okay now now now we're going to use sheet dot cell we're going to use sheet dot cell we're going to use sheet dot cell to get access to the cell at this row to get access to the cell at this row to get access to the cell at this row and the column should be three and the column should be three and the column should be three we get a cell object let's print its we get a cell object let's print its we get a cell object let's print its value and make sure value and make sure value and make sure we're on the right track we're on the right track we're on the right track so run our program so run our program so run our program these are the values we get these are the values we get these are the values we get 5.95 6.95 and 7.95 5.95 6.95 and 7.95 5.95 6.95 and 7.95 these are the values in the third column these are the values in the third column these are the values in the third column beautiful next we need to multiply each beautiful next we need to multiply each beautiful next we need to multiply each value by 0.9 value by 0.9 value by 0.9 so instead of printing cell.value we so instead of printing cell.value we so instead of printing cell.value we multiply it by 0.9 and this is the multiply it by 0.9 and this is the multiply it by 0.9 and this is the corrected corrected corrected underlying price underlying price underlying price so this is the mistake we're going to so this is the mistake we're going to so this is the mistake we're going to fix with our program fix with our program fix with our program now we need to add a new cell to our now we need to add a new cell to our now we need to add a new cell to our worksheet worksheet worksheet so we want to add all the corrected so we want to add all the corrected so we want to add all the corrected prices in a new column we could also prices in a new column we could also prices in a new column we could also overwrite the values in this column but overwrite the values in this column but overwrite the values in this column but in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to add a new column how to add a new column how to add a new column so using the same method now we need to so using the same method now we need to so using the same method now we need to get a reference to the cell in the given get a reference to the cell in the given get a reference to the cell in the given row but in the fourth column row but in the fourth column row but in the fourth column so we call so we call so we call sheet.cell and pass row and 4 as the sheet.cell and pass row and 4 as the sheet.cell and pass row and 4 as the arguments arguments arguments once again this returns a cell object once again this returns a cell object once again this returns a cell object let's store that in a separate variable let's store that in a separate variable let's store that in a separate variable and call it corrected and call it corrected and call it corrected underline price underline cell underline price underline cell underline price underline cell so note that my variable names are very so note that my variable names are very so note that my variable names are very descriptive there is no guesswork descriptive there is no guesswork descriptive there is no guesswork we have corrected price which holds the we have corrected price which holds the we have corrected price which holds the actual value and we have corrected price actual value and we have corrected price actual value and we have corrected price cell which is a sell object in this cell which is a sell object in this cell which is a sell object in this spreadsheet spreadsheet spreadsheet next we need to set the value for this next we need to set the value for this next we need to set the value for this cell so we set corrected price sell dot cell so we set corrected price sell dot cell so we set corrected price sell dot value to this corrected price value to this corrected price value to this corrected price with these view lines we can easily with these view lines we can easily with these view lines we can easily update our spreadsheet but first we need update our spreadsheet but first we need update our spreadsheet but first we need to save it so to save it so to save it so after our for loop we call workbook dot after our for loop we call workbook dot after our for loop we call workbook dot save now let's save this in a new file save now let's save this in a new file save now let's save this in a new file so we don't want to accidentally so we don't want to accidentally so we don't want to accidentally overwrite the original file in case our overwrite the original file in case our overwrite the original file in case our program has a bug program has a bug program has a bug so i'm going to call that so i'm going to call that so i'm going to call that transactions2.xlsx now finally let's run our program now finally let's run our program now finally let's run our program so you can see that happened in a split so you can see that happened in a split so you can see that happened in a split of a second now here we have a new file of a second now here we have a new file of a second now here we have a new file transactions2 when we open this we get transactions2 when we open this we get transactions2 when we open this we get something like this so you can see we something like this so you can see we something like this so you can see we have this fourth column with the updated have this fourth column with the updated have this fourth column with the updated prices beautiful so half of the problem prices beautiful so half of the problem prices beautiful so half of the problem is solved now we need to add a chart is solved now we need to add a chart is solved now we need to add a chart here here here to add a chart we need to import a to add a chart we need to import a to add a chart we need to import a couple of classes on the top couple of classes on the top couple of classes on the top so so so after this import statement let's type after this import statement let's type after this import statement let's type out from out from out from open pi excel dot chart open pi excel dot chart open pi excel dot chart import import import bar chart bar chart bar chart comma comma comma reference reference reference so let's see what's going on here so let's see what's going on here so let's see what's going on here in this package we have a module called in this package we have a module called in this package we have a module called chart and from this module we're chart and from this module we're chart and from this module we're importing two classes bar chart and importing two classes bar chart and importing two classes bar chart and reference again look at the naming reference again look at the naming reference again look at the naming convention used here the first letter of convention used here the first letter of convention used here the first letter of every word is capitalized every word is capitalized every word is capitalized also it's better to add a line break also it's better to add a line break also it's better to add a line break after our import statement to make our after our import statement to make our after our import statement to make our code cleaner code cleaner code cleaner so so so before we save our workbook we need to before we save our workbook we need to before we save our workbook we need to add a chart to the current sheet add a chart to the current sheet add a chart to the current sheet first we need to select a range of first we need to select a range of first we need to select a range of values for this exercise i'm going to values for this exercise i'm going to values for this exercise i'm going to select the values in the fourth column select the values in the fourth column select the values in the fourth column so all the values in rows 2 to 4. these so all the values in rows 2 to 4. these so all the values in rows 2 to 4. these are the values i'm going to use in our are the values i'm going to use in our are the values i'm going to use in our chart chart chart now in this particular example it now in this particular example it now in this particular example it doesn't really make sense to add a chart doesn't really make sense to add a chart doesn't really make sense to add a chart per transaction but that doesn't really per transaction but that doesn't really per transaction but that doesn't really matter we just want a bunch of numbers matter we just want a bunch of numbers matter we just want a bunch of numbers to create a chart to create a chart to create a chart so after our for loop we're going to use so after our for loop we're going to use so after our for loop we're going to use the reference class to select a range of the reference class to select a range of the reference class to select a range of values now the first argument in the values now the first argument in the values now the first argument in the constructor is the sheet constructor is the sheet constructor is the sheet so we pass our sheet here so we pass our sheet here so we pass our sheet here then we add four keyword arguments the then we add four keyword arguments the then we add four keyword arguments the first one is min underline row we set first one is min underline row we set first one is min underline row we set this to two this to two this to two the second one is max underline row we the second one is max underline row we the second one is max underline row we set this to the maximum row in this set this to the maximum row in this set this to the maximum row in this sheet that is sheet dot max underline sheet that is sheet dot max underline sheet that is sheet dot max underline row so we want to select the cells in row so we want to select the cells in row so we want to select the cells in row two row two row two to four okay to four okay to four okay now to make this code a little bit now to make this code a little bit now to make this code a little bit cleaner i'm going to put this on a new cleaner i'm going to put this on a new cleaner i'm going to put this on a new line so you can see clearly line so you can see clearly line so you can see clearly now this is going to select all the now this is going to select all the now this is going to select all the cells in all the columns in these rows cells in all the columns in these rows cells in all the columns in these rows that's not what we want we only want the that's not what we want we only want the that's not what we want we only want the values in the fourth column values in the fourth column values in the fourth column so back here we need to set a couple so back here we need to set a couple so back here we need to set a couple more keyword arguments min underline more keyword arguments min underline more keyword arguments min underline call or column we set that to four and call or column we set that to four and call or column we set that to four and also max underlying call we set that to also max underlying call we set that to also max underlying call we set that to four as well four as well four as well so we're limiting the range of cells so we're limiting the range of cells so we're limiting the range of cells we're selecting to the fourth column we're selecting to the fourth column we're selecting to the fourth column okay now okay now okay now we're creating an instance of the we're creating an instance of the we're creating an instance of the reference class let's store the result reference class let's store the result reference class let's store the result in a variable called values so this in a variable called values so this in a variable called values so this values object will have all these values values object will have all these values values object will have all these values in the fourth column now we are ready to in the fourth column now we are ready to in the fourth column now we are ready to create a chart create a chart create a chart so we create an instance of the bar so we create an instance of the bar so we create an instance of the bar chart class chart class chart class and store it in this object and store it in this object and store it in this object next we call chart that add underlying next we call chart that add underlying next we call chart that add underlying data and pass our values data and pass our values data and pass our values that is pretty straightforward finally that is pretty straightforward finally that is pretty straightforward finally we need to add this chart to our sheet we need to add this chart to our sheet we need to add this chart to our sheet so we call sheet that add underline so we call sheet that add underline so we call sheet that add underline chart chart chart and pass this chart object we should and pass this chart object we should and pass this chart object we should also specify where we want to add this also specify where we want to add this also specify where we want to add this chart chart chart let's say we want to add it here on row let's say we want to add it here on row let's say we want to add it here on row 2 after the fourth column so the 2 after the fourth column so the 2 after the fourth column so the coordinates of this cell is e 2 and this coordinates of this cell is e 2 and this coordinates of this cell is e 2 and this is going to be the top left corner of is going to be the top left corner of is going to be the top left corner of our chart our chart our chart so as the coordinate i'm going to pass so as the coordinate i'm going to pass so as the coordinate i'm going to pass e2 that's all we had to do done e2 that's all we had to do done e2 that's all we had to do done let's run our program one more time let's run our program one more time let's run our program one more time beautiful let's open up the updated beautiful let's open up the updated beautiful let's open up the updated workbook workbook workbook and here's the end result so right after and here's the end result so right after and here's the end result so right after the fourth column we have this beautiful the fourth column we have this beautiful the fourth column we have this beautiful chart now we could take this to the next chart now we could take this to the next chart now we could take this to the next level we could add a legend here we level we could add a legend here we level we could add a legend here we could change the color of these bars we could change the color of these bars we could change the color of these bars we could even use a different kind of chart could even use a different kind of chart could even use a different kind of chart it doesn't have to be a bar chart so to it doesn't have to be a bar chart so to it doesn't have to be a bar chart so to learn more about this you can read the learn more about this you can read the learn more about this you can read the documentation for open pi excel so our documentation for open pi excel so our documentation for open pi excel so our program is complete but our code is program is complete but our code is program is complete but our code is dirty it's not clean it's not organized dirty it's not clean it's not organized dirty it's not clean it's not organized we don't have any functions here we have we don't have any functions here we have we don't have any functions here we have written all the code in app.pi so let's written all the code in app.pi so let's written all the code in app.pi so let's go ahead and organize this code like a go ahead and organize this code like a go ahead and organize this code like a professional software developer professional software developer professional software developer so on line four we're loading our so on line four we're loading our so on line four we're loading our workbook then we're getting a reference workbook then we're getting a reference workbook then we're getting a reference to the first sheet but we don't really to the first sheet but we don't really to the first sheet but we don't really need these two lines here this was need these two lines here this was need these two lines here this was purely for demonstration to show you how purely for demonstration to show you how purely for demonstration to show you how you can access a cell so let's delete you can access a cell so let's delete you can access a cell so let's delete these unnecessary lines this is a very these unnecessary lines this is a very these unnecessary lines this is a very important practice as you're coding important practice as you're coding important practice as you're coding always look at your code always review always look at your code always review always look at your code always review it see if you have some code that is not it see if you have some code that is not it see if you have some code that is not used always delete those used always delete those used always delete those okay next we're iterating over all the okay next we're iterating over all the okay next we're iterating over all the rows fixing the prices and then we rows fixing the prices and then we rows fixing the prices and then we select these values to add a chart and select these values to add a chart and select these values to add a chart and finally we save the workbook now if we finally we save the workbook now if we finally we save the workbook now if we were going to use this to automate the were going to use this to automate the were going to use this to automate the process of updating thousands of process of updating thousands of process of updating thousands of spreadsheets this program wouldn't work spreadsheets this program wouldn't work spreadsheets this program wouldn't work because it's only relying because it's only relying because it's only relying on this file so we want to reorganize on this file so we want to reorganize on this file so we want to reorganize this code and move it inside of a this code and move it inside of a this code and move it inside of a function this function should take the function this function should take the function this function should take the name of the file as an input so let's name of the file as an input so let's name of the file as an input so let's define a function define a function define a function let's call it process underline workbook let's call it process underline workbook let's call it process underline workbook it gets a file name now we move all the it gets a file name now we move all the it gets a file name now we move all the code inside of this function so let's code inside of this function so let's code inside of this function so let's select everything select everything select everything and then and then and then press tab beautiful press tab beautiful press tab beautiful now now now back to our function back to our function back to our function instead of loading this transactions instead of loading this transactions instead of loading this transactions file we're going to load file we're going to load file we're going to load this file name that's better this file name that's better this file name that's better also now that our program is working also now that our program is working also now that our program is working properly there is really no need to properly there is really no need to properly there is really no need to store the result in a separate file so store the result in a separate file so store the result in a separate file so here we can simply overwrite the same here we can simply overwrite the same here we can simply overwrite the same file file file so so so let's pass file name let's pass file name let's pass file name that is the end of our function that is the end of our function that is the end of our function so now we have this reusable function we so now we have this reusable function we so now we have this reusable function we can simply reuse this to process can simply reuse this to process can simply reuse this to process thousands of spreadsheets thousands of spreadsheets thousands of spreadsheets earlier in this python course you earlier in this python course you earlier in this python course you learned how to find all the files in the learned how to find all the files in the learned how to find all the files in the directory so you can get each file in a directory so you can get each file in a directory so you can get each file in a directory and pass the name of the file directory and pass the name of the file directory and pass the name of the file to this function this function will go to this function this function will go to this function this function will go ahead and update that spreadsheet in ahead and update that spreadsheet in ahead and update that spreadsheet in just a second or less so that was just one example of using so that was just one example of using so that was just one example of using python to automate repetitive boring python to automate repetitive boring python to automate repetitive boring tasks that waste your time but tasks that waste your time but tasks that waste your time but automation is not just about processing automation is not just about processing automation is not just about processing excel spreadsheets there are so many excel spreadsheets there are so many excel spreadsheets there are so many things we can automate here's a question things we can automate here's a question things we can automate here's a question for you what do you want to automate how for you what do you want to automate how for you what do you want to automate how do you want to use python to make your do you want to use python to make your do you want to use python to make your life easier use the comment box below life easier use the comment box below life easier use the comment box below and let me know i love to hear about and let me know i love to hear about and let me know i love to hear about your ideas your ideas your ideas next we're going to work on a project next we're going to work on a project next we're going to work on a project that involves machine learning which is that involves machine learning which is that involves machine learning which is a subset of artificial intelligence are a subset of artificial intelligence are a subset of artificial intelligence are you excited let's get started in this section you're going to learn in this section you're going to learn in this section you're going to learn about machine learning which is a subset about machine learning which is a subset about machine learning which is a subset of ai or artificial intelligence it's of ai or artificial intelligence it's of ai or artificial intelligence it's one of the trending topics in the world one of the trending topics in the world one of the trending topics in the world these days and it's going to have a lot these days and it's going to have a lot these days and it's going to have a lot of applications in the future here's an of applications in the future here's an of applications in the future here's an example imagine i ask you to write a example imagine i ask you to write a example imagine i ask you to write a program to scan an image and tell if program to scan an image and tell if program to scan an image and tell if it's a cat or a doc it's a cat or a doc it's a cat or a doc if you want to build this program using if you want to build this program using if you want to build this program using traditional programming techniques your traditional programming techniques your traditional programming techniques your program is going to get overly complex program is going to get overly complex program is going to get overly complex you will have to come up with lots of you will have to come up with lots of you will have to come up with lots of rules to look for specific curves edges rules to look for specific curves edges rules to look for specific curves edges and colors in an image to tell if it's a and colors in an image to tell if it's a and colors in an image to tell if it's a cat or a dog but if i give you a black cat or a dog but if i give you a black cat or a dog but if i give you a black and white photo your rules may not work and white photo your rules may not work and white photo your rules may not work they may break then you'll have to they may break then you'll have to they may break then you'll have to rewrite them or i might give you a rewrite them or i might give you a rewrite them or i might give you a picture of a cat or a dog from a picture of a cat or a dog from a picture of a cat or a dog from a different angle that you did not predict different angle that you did not predict different angle that you did not predict before so solving this problem using before so solving this problem using before so solving this problem using traditional programming techniques is traditional programming techniques is traditional programming techniques is going to get overly complex or sometimes going to get overly complex or sometimes going to get overly complex or sometimes impossible now to make the matter worse impossible now to make the matter worse impossible now to make the matter worse what if in the future i ask you to what if in the future i ask you to what if in the future i ask you to extend this program such that it extend this program such that it extend this program such that it supports three kinds of animals cats supports three kinds of animals cats supports three kinds of animals cats dogs and horses once again you'll have dogs and horses once again you'll have dogs and horses once again you'll have to rewrite all those rules that's not to rewrite all those rules that's not to rewrite all those rules that's not gonna work so machine learning is a gonna work so machine learning is a gonna work so machine learning is a technique to solve these kind of technique to solve these kind of technique to solve these kind of problems and this is how it works we problems and this is how it works we problems and this is how it works we build a model or an engine and give it build a model or an engine and give it build a model or an engine and give it lots and lots of data for example we lots and lots of data for example we lots and lots of data for example we give you thousands or tens of thousands give you thousands or tens of thousands give you thousands or tens of thousands of pictures of cats and dogs our model of pictures of cats and dogs our model of pictures of cats and dogs our model will then find and learn patterns in the will then find and learn patterns in the will then find and learn patterns in the input data so we can give it a new input data so we can give it a new input data so we can give it a new picture of a cat that it hasn't seen picture of a cat that it hasn't seen picture of a cat that it hasn't seen before and ask it is it a cat or a dog before and ask it is it a cat or a dog before and ask it is it a cat or a dog or a horse and it will tell us with a or a horse and it will tell us with a or a horse and it will tell us with a certain level of accuracy the more input certain level of accuracy the more input certain level of accuracy the more input data we give it the more accurate our data we give it the more accurate our data we give it the more accurate our model is going to be model is going to be model is going to be so that was a very basic example but so that was a very basic example but so that was a very basic example but machine learning has other applications machine learning has other applications machine learning has other applications in self-driving cars robotics language in self-driving cars robotics language in self-driving cars robotics language processing vision processing forecasting processing vision processing forecasting processing vision processing forecasting things like stock market trends and the things like stock market trends and the things like stock market trends and the weather games and so on so that's the weather games and so on so that's the weather games and so on so that's the basic idea about machine learning next basic idea about machine learning next basic idea about machine learning next we'll look at machine learning in action a machine learning project involves a a machine learning project involves a a machine learning project involves a number of steps the first step is to number of steps the first step is to number of steps the first step is to import our data which often comes in the import our data which often comes in the import our data which often comes in the form of a csv file we might have a form of a csv file we might have a form of a csv file we might have a database with lots of data we can simply database with lots of data we can simply database with lots of data we can simply export that data and store it in a csv export that data and store it in a csv export that data and store it in a csv file for the purpose of our machine file for the purpose of our machine file for the purpose of our machine learning project so we import our data learning project so we import our data learning project so we import our data next we need to clean it and this next we need to clean it and this next we need to clean it and this involves tasks such as removing involves tasks such as removing involves tasks such as removing duplicated data if you have duplicates duplicated data if you have duplicates duplicated data if you have duplicates in the data we don't want to feed this in the data we don't want to feed this in the data we don't want to feed this to our model because otherwise our model to our model because otherwise our model to our model because otherwise our model will learn bad patterns in the data and will learn bad patterns in the data and will learn bad patterns in the data and it will produce the wrong result so we it will produce the wrong result so we it will produce the wrong result so we should make sure that our input data is should make sure that our input data is should make sure that our input data is in a good and clean shape if there are in a good and clean shape if there are in a good and clean shape if there are data that is irrelevant we should remove data that is irrelevant we should remove data that is irrelevant we should remove them if they are duplicated or them if they are duplicated or them if they are duplicated or incomplete we can remove or modify them incomplete we can remove or modify them incomplete we can remove or modify them if our data is text based like the name if our data is text based like the name if our data is text based like the name of countries or genres of music or cats of countries or genres of music or cats of countries or genres of music or cats and dogs we need to convert them to and dogs we need to convert them to and dogs we need to convert them to numerical values so this step really numerical values so this step really numerical values so this step really depends on the kind of data we are depends on the kind of data we are depends on the kind of data we are working with every project is different working with every project is different working with every project is different now that we have a clean data set we now that we have a clean data set we now that we have a clean data set we need to split it into two segments one need to split it into two segments one need to split it into two segments one for training our model and the other for for training our model and the other for for training our model and the other for testing it to make sure that our model testing it to make sure that our model testing it to make sure that our model produces the right result produces the right result produces the right result for example if you have a thousand for example if you have a thousand for example if you have a thousand pictures of cats and dogs we can reserve pictures of cats and dogs we can reserve pictures of cats and dogs we can reserve eighty percent for training and the eighty percent for training and the eighty percent for training and the other twenty percent for testing the other twenty percent for testing the other twenty percent for testing the next step is to create a model and this next step is to create a model and this next step is to create a model and this involves selecting an algorithm to involves selecting an algorithm to involves selecting an algorithm to analyze the data there are so many analyze the data there are so many analyze the data there are so many different machine learning algorithms different machine learning algorithms different machine learning algorithms out there such as decision trees neural out there such as decision trees neural out there such as decision trees neural networks and so on each algorithm has networks and so on each algorithm has networks and so on each algorithm has pros and cons in terms of accuracy and pros and cons in terms of accuracy and pros and cons in terms of accuracy and performance so the algorithm you choose performance so the algorithm you choose performance so the algorithm you choose depends on the kind of problem you're depends on the kind of problem you're depends on the kind of problem you're trying to solve and your input data now trying to solve and your input data now trying to solve and your input data now the good news is that we don't have to the good news is that we don't have to the good news is that we don't have to explicitly program an algorithm there explicitly program an algorithm there explicitly program an algorithm there are libraries out there that provide are libraries out there that provide are libraries out there that provide these algorithms one of the most popular these algorithms one of the most popular these algorithms one of the most popular ones which we're going to look at in ones which we're going to look at in ones which we're going to look at in this tutorial is scikit-learn this tutorial is scikit-learn this tutorial is scikit-learn so we build a model using an algorithm so we build a model using an algorithm so we build a model using an algorithm next we need to train our model so we next we need to train our model so we next we need to train our model so we feed it our training data our model will feed it our training data our model will feed it our training data our model will then look for the patterns in the data then look for the patterns in the data then look for the patterns in the data so next we can ask it to make so next we can ask it to make so next we can ask it to make predictions back to our example of cats predictions back to our example of cats predictions back to our example of cats and dogs we can ask our model is this a and dogs we can ask our model is this a and dogs we can ask our model is this a cat or a dog and our model will make a cat or a dog and our model will make a cat or a dog and our model will make a prediction prediction prediction now the prediction is not always now the prediction is not always now the prediction is not always accurate in fact when you start out it's accurate in fact when you start out it's accurate in fact when you start out it's very likely that your predictions are very likely that your predictions are very likely that your predictions are inaccurate so we need to evaluate the inaccurate so we need to evaluate the inaccurate so we need to evaluate the predictions and measure their accuracy predictions and measure their accuracy predictions and measure their accuracy then we need to get back to our model then we need to get back to our model then we need to get back to our model and either select a different algorithm and either select a different algorithm and either select a different algorithm that is going to produce a more accurate that is going to produce a more accurate that is going to produce a more accurate result for the kind of problem we're result for the kind of problem we're result for the kind of problem we're trying to solve or fine-tune the trying to solve or fine-tune the trying to solve or fine-tune the parameters of our model so each parameters of our model so each parameters of our model so each algorithm has parameters that we can algorithm has parameters that we can algorithm has parameters that we can modify to optimize the accuracy modify to optimize the accuracy modify to optimize the accuracy so these are the high-level steps that so these are the high-level steps that so these are the high-level steps that you follow in a machine learning project you follow in a machine learning project you follow in a machine learning project next we'll look at the libraries and next we'll look at the libraries and next we'll look at the libraries and tools for machine learning in this lecture we're going to look at in this lecture we're going to look at in this lecture we're going to look at the popular python libraries that we use the popular python libraries that we use the popular python libraries that we use in machine learning projects the first in machine learning projects the first in machine learning projects the first one is numpy which provides a one is numpy which provides a one is numpy which provides a multi-dimensional array very very multi-dimensional array very very multi-dimensional array very very popular library the second one is pandas popular library the second one is pandas popular library the second one is pandas which is a data analysis library that which is a data analysis library that which is a data analysis library that provides a concept called data frame a provides a concept called data frame a provides a concept called data frame a data frame is a two-dimensional data data frame is a two-dimensional data data frame is a two-dimensional data structure similar to an excel structure similar to an excel structure similar to an excel spreadsheet so we have rows and columns spreadsheet so we have rows and columns spreadsheet so we have rows and columns we can select data in a row or a column we can select data in a row or a column we can select data in a row or a column or a range of rows and columns again or a range of rows and columns again or a range of rows and columns again very very popular in machine learning very very popular in machine learning very very popular in machine learning and data science projects and data science projects and data science projects the third library is matplotlib which is the third library is matplotlib which is the third library is matplotlib which is a two-dimensional plotting library for a two-dimensional plotting library for a two-dimensional plotting library for creating graphs and plots creating graphs and plots creating graphs and plots the next library is scikit-learn which the next library is scikit-learn which the next library is scikit-learn which is one of the most popular machine is one of the most popular machine is one of the most popular machine learning libraries that provides all learning libraries that provides all learning libraries that provides all these common algorithms like decision these common algorithms like decision these common algorithms like decision trees neural networks and so on trees neural networks and so on trees neural networks and so on now when working with machine learning now when working with machine learning now when working with machine learning projects we use an environment called projects we use an environment called projects we use an environment called jupiter for writing our code technically jupiter for writing our code technically jupiter for writing our code technically we can still use vs code or any other we can still use vs code or any other we can still use vs code or any other code editors but these editors are not code editors but these editors are not code editors but these editors are not ideal for machine learning projects ideal for machine learning projects ideal for machine learning projects because we frequently need to inspect because we frequently need to inspect because we frequently need to inspect the data and that is really hard in the data and that is really hard in the data and that is really hard in environments like vs code and terminal environments like vs code and terminal environments like vs code and terminal if you're working with a table of 10 or if you're working with a table of 10 or if you're working with a table of 10 or 20 columns visualizing this data in a 20 columns visualizing this data in a 20 columns visualizing this data in a terminal window is really really terminal window is really really terminal window is really really difficult and messy so that's why we use difficult and messy so that's why we use difficult and messy so that's why we use jupiter it makes it really easy to jupiter it makes it really easy to jupiter it makes it really easy to inspect our data inspect our data inspect our data now to install jupiter we're going to now to install jupiter we're going to now to install jupiter we're going to use a platform called anaconda so head use a platform called anaconda so head use a platform called anaconda so head over to anaconda.com over to anaconda.com over to anaconda.com download download download on this page you can download anaconda on this page you can download anaconda on this page you can download anaconda distribution for your operating system distribution for your operating system distribution for your operating system so we have distributions for windows mac so we have distributions for windows mac so we have distributions for windows mac and linux so let's go ahead and and linux so let's go ahead and and linux so let's go ahead and install anaconda for python 3.7 install anaconda for python 3.7 install anaconda for python 3.7 download all right so here's anaconda downloaded all right so here's anaconda downloaded all right so here's anaconda downloaded on my machine let's double click this on my machine let's double click this on my machine let's double click this all right first it's going to run a all right

beautiful thing about anaconda is that it will thing about anaconda is that it will thing about anaconda is that it will install jupyter as well as all those install jupyter as well as all those install jupyter as well as all those popular data science libraries like popular data science libraries like popular data science libraries like numpy pandas and so on so we don't have numpy pandas and so on so we don't have numpy pandas and so on so we don't have to manually install this using to manually install this using to manually install this using pip right now as part of the next step pip right now as part of the next step pip right now as part of the next step anaconda is suggesting to install anaconda is suggesting to install anaconda is suggesting to install microsoft vs code we already have this microsoft vs code we already have this microsoft vs code we already have this on our machine so we don't have to on our machine so we don't have to on our machine so we don't have to install it we can go with continue install it we can go with continue install it we can go with continue and close the installation now finally and close the installation now finally and close the installation now finally we can move this to trash because we we can move this to trash because we we can move this to trash because we don't need this installer in the future don't need this installer in the future don't need this installer in the future all right now open up a terminal window all right now open up a terminal window all right now open up a terminal window and type jupyter and type jupyter and type jupyter with a y space with a y space with a y space notebook notebook notebook this will start the notebook server on this will start the notebook server on this will start the notebook server on your machine so enter your machine so enter your machine so enter there you go this will start the there you go this will start the there you go this will start the notebook server on your machine you can notebook server on your machine you can notebook server on your machine you can see these default messages here don't see these default messages here don't see these default messages here don't worry about them now it automatically worry about them now it automatically worry about them now it automatically opens a browser window pointing to opens a browser window pointing to opens a browser window pointing to localhost port 888 localhost port 888 localhost port 888 this is what we call jupiter dashboard this is what we call jupiter dashboard this is what we call jupiter dashboard on this dashboard we have a few tabs the on this dashboard we have a few tabs the on this dashboard we have a few tabs the first tab is the files tab and by first tab is the files tab and by first tab is the files tab and by default this points to your home default this points to your home default this points to your home directory so every user on your machine directory so every user on your machine directory so every user on your machine has a home directory this is my home has a home directory this is my home has a home directory this is my home directory on mac you can see here we directory on mac you can see here we directory on mac you can see here we have a desktop folder as well as have a desktop folder as well as have a desktop folder as well as documents downloads and so on on your documents downloads and so on on your documents downloads and so on on your machine you're going to see different machine you're going to see different machine you're going to see different folders so someone on your machine you folders so someone on your machine you folders so someone on your machine you need to create a jupyter notebook i'm need to create a jupyter notebook i'm need to create a jupyter notebook i'm going to go to desktop here's my desktop going to go to desktop here's my desktop going to go to desktop here's my desktop i don't have anything here i don't have anything here i don't have anything here and then and then and then click new click new click new i want to create a notebook for python i want to create a notebook for python i want to create a notebook for python 3. in this notebook we can write python 3. in this notebook we can write python 3. in this notebook we can write python code and execute it line by line we can code and execute it line by line we can code and execute it line by line we can easily visualize our data as you will easily visualize our data as you will easily visualize our data as you will see over the next few videos so let's go see over the next few videos so let's go see over the next few videos so let's go ahead with this all right here's our first notebook we all right here's our first notebook we all right here's our first notebook we can see by default it's called untitled can see by default it's called untitled can see by default it's called untitled let's change that to let's change that to let's change that to hello world so this is going to be the hello world so this is going to be the hello world so this is going to be the hello world of our machine learning hello world of our machine learning hello world of our machine learning project project project let's rename this let's rename this let's rename this now if you look at your desktop you can now if you look at your desktop you can now if you look at your desktop you can see this file see this file see this file helloworld.i pi helloworld.i pi helloworld.i pi nb this is a jupyter notebook it's kind nb this is a jupyter notebook it's kind nb this is a jupyter notebook it's kind of similar to our pi files where we of similar to our pi files where we of similar to our pi files where we write our python code but it includes write our python code but it includes write our python code but it includes additional data that jupiter uses to additional data that jupiter uses to additional data that jupiter uses to execute our code execute our code execute our code so back to our notebook so back to our notebook so back to our notebook let's do let's do let's do a print a print a print hello world hello world hello world and then click this run button here and then click this run button here and then click this run button here and here's the result printed in jupiter and here's the result printed in jupiter and here's the result printed in jupiter so we don't have to navigate back and so we don't have to navigate back and so we don't have to navigate back and forth between the terminal window we can forth between the terminal window we can forth between the terminal window we can see all the result right here see all the result right here see all the result right here next i'm going to show you how to load a next i'm going to show you how to load a next i'm going to show you how to load a data set from a csv file in jupyter all right in this lecture we're going to all right in this lecture we're going to all right in this lecture we're going to download a data set from a very popular download a data set from a very popular download a data set from a very popular website called website called website called gaggle is basically a place to do data gaggle is basically a place to do data gaggle is basically a place to do data science projects so the first thing you science projects so the first thing you science projects so the first thing you need to do is to create an account you need to do is to create an account you need to do is to create an account you can sign up with facebook google or can sign up with facebook google or can sign up with facebook google or using a custom email and password once using a custom email and password once using a custom email and password once you sign up then come back here on you sign up then come back here on you sign up then come back here on kaggle.com here in the search bar kaggle.com here in the search bar kaggle.com here in the search bar search for search for search for video game sales this is the name of a video game sales this is the name of a video game sales this is the name of a very popular data set that we're going very popular data set that we're going very popular data set that we're going to use in this lecture so to use in this lecture so to use in this lecture so here in this list you can see the first here in this list you can see the first here in this list you can see the first item with this kind of reddish icon so item with this kind of reddish icon so item with this kind of reddish icon so let's go with that let's go with that let's go with that as you can see this data set includes as you can see this data set includes as you can see this data set includes the sales data for more than 16 000 the sales data for more than 16 000 the sales data for more than 16 000 video games video games video games on this page you can see the description on this page you can see the description on this page you can see the description of various columns in this data set we of various columns in this data set we of various columns in this data set we have have have rank name platform year and so on so rank name platform year and so on so rank name platform year and so on so here's our data source it's a csv file here's our data source it's a csv file here's our data source it's a csv file called vgsales.csv called vgsales.csv called vgsales.csv as you can see there are over 16 000 as you can see there are over 16 000 as you can see there are over 16 000 rows and 11 columns in this data set rows and 11 columns in this data set rows and 11 columns in this data set right below that you can see the first right below that you can see the first right below that you can see the first few records of this data set so here's few records of this data set so here's few records of this data set so here's our first record the ranking for this our first record the ranking for this our first record the ranking for this game is one it's the wii sports game for game is one it's the wii sports game for game is one it's the wii sports game for we as the platform and it was released we as the platform and it was released we as the platform and it was released in year 2006 in year 2006 in year 2006 now what i want you to do now what i want you to do now what i want you to do is to go ahead and download this data is to go ahead and download this data is to go ahead and download this data set and as i told you before you need to set and as i told you before you need to set and as i told you before you need to sign in before you can download this sign in before you can download this sign in before you can download this so this will give you a zip file as you so this will give you a zip file as you so this will give you a zip file as you can see here can see here can see here here's our csv file now i want you to here's our csv file now i want you to here's our csv file now i want you to put this right next to your jupiter put this right next to your jupiter put this right next to your jupiter notebook on my machine that is on my notebook on my machine that is on my notebook on my machine that is on my desktop so i'm going to drag and drop desktop so i'm going to drag and drop desktop so i'm going to drag and drop this onto the desktop folder this onto the desktop folder this onto the desktop folder now now now if you look at the desktop you can see if you look at the desktop you can see if you look at the desktop you can see here's my jupyter hello world notebook here's my jupyter hello world notebook here's my jupyter hello world notebook and right next to that we have and right next to that we have and right next to that we have vgsales.csv vgsales.csv vgsales.csv with that with that with that we go back to our jupiter notebook we go back to our jupiter notebook we go back to our jupiter notebook let's remove the first line and instead let's remove the first line and instead let's remove the first line and instead import import import pandas pandas pandas as pd with this we're importing pandas as pd with this we're importing pandas as pd with this we're importing pandas module and renaming it to pd so we don't module and renaming it to pd so we don't module and renaming it to pd so we don't have to type pandas. several times in have to type pandas. several times in have to type pandas. several times in this code this code this code now let's type pd dot now let's type pd dot now let's type pd dot read underline csv read underline csv read underline csv and and and pass the name of our csv file that is vg pass the name of our csv file that is vg pass the name of our csv file that is vg sales.csv now because this csv file is sales.csv now because this csv file is sales.csv now because this csv file is in the current folder right next to our in the current folder right next to our in the current folder right next to our jupyter notebook we can easily load it jupyter notebook we can easily load it jupyter notebook we can easily load it otherwise we'll have to supply the full otherwise we'll have to supply the full otherwise we'll have to supply the full path to this file so path to this file so path to this file so this returns a data frame object which this returns a data frame object which this returns a data frame object which is like an excel spreadsheet let me show is like an excel spreadsheet let me show is like an excel spreadsheet let me show you so you so you so we store it here we store it here we store it here and then we can simply type df to and then we can simply type df to and then we can simply type df to inspect it so one more time let's run inspect it so one more time let's run inspect it so one more time let's run this program this program this program here's our data frame with these rows here's our data frame with these rows here's our data frame with these rows and columns so we have rank name and columns so we have rank name and columns so we have rank name platform and so on platform and so on platform and so on now this data frame object has lots of now this data frame object has lots of now this data frame object has lots of attributes and methods that we're not attributes and methods that we're not attributes and methods that we're not going to cover in this tutorial that's going to cover in this tutorial that's going to cover in this tutorial that's really beyond the scope of what we're really beyond the scope of what we're really beyond the scope of what we're going to do so i'll leave it up to you going to do so i'll leave it up to you going to do so i'll leave it up to you to read panda's documentation or follow to read panda's documentation or follow to read panda's documentation or follow other tutorials to learn about pandas other tutorials to learn about pandas other tutorials to learn about pandas data frames but in this lecture i'm data frames but in this lecture i'm data frames but in this lecture i'm going to show you some of the most going to show you some of the most going to show you some of the most useful methods and attributes useful methods and attributes useful methods and attributes the first one is shape the first one is shape the first one is shape so shape let's run this one more time so shape let's run this one more time so shape let's run this one more time so here's the shape of this data set we so here's the shape of this data set we so here's the shape of this data set we have over 16 000 records and 11 columns have over 16 000 records and 11 columns have over 16 000 records and 11 columns technically this is a two dimensional technically this is a two dimensional technically this is a two dimensional array of 16 thousand and array of 16 thousand and array of 16 thousand and okay okay okay now you can see here we have another now you can see here we have another now you can see here we have another segment for writing code so we don't segment for writing code so we don't segment for writing code so we don't have to write all the code in the first have to write all the code in the first have to write all the code in the first segment so here in the second segment we segment so here in the second segment we segment so here in the second segment we can call one of the methods of the data can call one of the methods of the data can call one of the methods of the data frame that is df dot describe frame that is df dot describe frame that is df dot describe now when we run this program now when we run this program now when we run this program we can see the output for each segment we can see the output for each segment we can see the output for each segment right next to it so here's our first right next to it so here's our first right next to it so here's our first segment here we have these three lines segment here we have these three lines segment here we have these three lines and this is the output of the last line and this is the output of the last line and this is the output of the last line below that we have our second segment below that we have our second segment below that we have our second segment here we're calling the describe method here we're calling the describe method here we're calling the describe method and right below that we have the output and right below that we have the output and right below that we have the output of this segment so this is the beauty of of this segment so this is the beauty of of this segment so this is the beauty of jupyter we can easily visualize our data jupyter we can easily visualize our data jupyter we can easily visualize our data doing this with vs code and terminal doing this with vs code and terminal doing this with vs code and terminal windows is really tedious and clunky so windows is really tedious and clunky so windows is really tedious and clunky so what is this describe method returning what is this describe method returning what is this describe method returning basically it's returning some basic basically it's returning some basic basically it's returning some basic information about each column in this information about each column in this information about each column in this data set so as you saw earlier we have data set so as you saw earlier we have data set so as you saw earlier we have columns like rank year and so on columns like rank year and so on columns like rank year and so on these are the columns with numerical these are the columns with numerical these are the columns with numerical values now for each column we have the values now for each column we have the values now for each column we have the count which is the number of records in count which is the number of records in count which is the number of records in that column you can see our rank column that column you can see our rank column that column you can see our rank column has 16 has 16 has 16 598 records whereas the year column has 598 records whereas the year column has 598 records whereas the year column has 327 records 327 records 327 records so this shows that some of our records so this shows that some of our records so this shows that some of our records don't have the value for the year column don't have the value for the year column don't have the value for the year column we have null values so in a real data we have null values so in a real data we have null values so in a real data science or machine learning project science or machine learning project science or machine learning project we'll have to use some techniques to we'll have to use some techniques to we'll have to use some techniques to clean up our data set one option is to clean up our data set one option is to clean up our data set one option is to remove the records that don't have a remove the records that don't have a remove the records that don't have a value for the year column or we can value for the year column or we can value for the year column or we can assign them a default value that really assign them a default value that really assign them a default value that really depends on the project now another depends on the project now another depends on the project now another attribute for each column is mean so attribute for each column is mean so attribute for each column is mean so this is the average of all the values this is the average of all the values this is the average of all the values now in the case of the rank column this now in the case of the rank column this now in the case of the rank column this value doesn't really matter but look at value doesn't really matter but look at value doesn't really matter but look at the year the year the year so the average year for all these video so the average year for all these video so the average year for all these video games in our data set is 2006 and this games in our data set is 2006 and this games in our data set is 2006 and this might be important in the problem we're might be important in the problem we're might be important in the problem we're trying to solve trying to solve trying to solve we also have standard deviation which is we also have standard deviation which is we also have standard deviation which is a measure to quantify the amount of a measure to quantify the amount of a measure to quantify the amount of variation in our set of values below variation in our set of values below variation in our set of values below that we have min that we have min that we have min as an example the minimum value for the as an example the minimum value for the as an example the minimum value for the year column is 1980. so quite often when year column is 1980. so quite often when year column is 1980. so quite often when we work with a new data set we call the we work with a new data set we call the we work with a new data set we call the describe method to get some basic describe method to get some basic describe method to get some basic statistics about our data statistics about our data statistics about our data let me show you another useful attribute let me show you another useful attribute let me show you another useful attribute so in the next segment let's type so in the next segment let's type so in the next segment let's type df.values df.values df.values let's run this let's run this let's run this as you can see this returns a as you can see this returns a as you can see this returns a two-dimensional array this square two-dimensional array this square two-dimensional array this square bracket indicates the outer array bracket indicates the outer array bracket indicates the outer array and the second one represents the inner and the second one represents the inner and the second one represents the inner array so the first element in our outer array so the first element in our outer array so the first element in our outer array is an array itself these are the array is an array itself these are the array is an array itself these are the values in this array which basically values in this array which basically values in this array which basically represent the first row in our data set represent the first row in our data set represent the first row in our data set so the video game with ranking one which so the video game with ranking one which so the video game with ranking one which is called wii sports is called wii sports is called wii sports so this was a basic overview of pando's so this was a basic overview of pando's so this was a basic overview of pando's data frames in the next lecture i'm data frames in the next lecture i'm data frames in the next lecture i'm going to show you some of the useful going to show you some of the useful going to show you some of the useful shortcuts of jupyter in this lecture i'm going to show you in this lecture i'm going to show you in this lecture i'm going to show you some of the most useful shortcuts in some of the most useful shortcuts in some of the most useful shortcuts in jupyter jupyter jupyter now the first thing i want you to pay now the first thing i want you to pay now the first thing i want you to pay attention to is this green bar on the attention to is this green bar on the attention to is this green bar on the left this indicates that this cell is left this indicates that this cell is left this indicates that this cell is currently in the edit mode so we can currently in the edit mode so we can currently in the edit mode so we can write code here write code here write code here now now now if we press the escape key if we press the escape key if we press the escape key green turns to blue and that means this green turns to blue and that means this green turns to blue and that means this cell is currently in the command mode so cell is currently in the command mode so cell is currently in the command mode so basically the activated cell can be basically the activated cell can be basically the activated cell can be either in the edit mode or the command either in the edit mode or the command either in the edit mode or the command mode depending on the mode we have mode depending on the mode we have mode depending on the mode we have different shortcuts so here we're different shortcuts so here we're different shortcuts so here we're currently in the command mode currently in the command mode currently in the command mode if we press h if we press h if we press h we can see the list of all the keyboard we can see the list of all the keyboard we can see the list of all the keyboard shortcuts shortcuts shortcuts right above this list you can see right above this list you can see right above this list you can see mac os modifier keys these are the extra mac os modifier keys these are the extra mac os modifier keys these are the extra keys that we have on a mac keyboard if keys that we have on a mac keyboard if keys that we have on a mac keyboard if you're a windows user you're not going you're a windows user you're not going you're a windows user you're not going to see this so as an example here is the to see this so as an example here is the to see this so as an example here is the shape of the command key this is control shape of the command key this is control shape of the command key this is control this is option and so on this is option and so on this is option and so on with this guideline you can easily with this guideline you can easily with this guideline you can easily understand the shortcut associated with understand the shortcut associated with understand the shortcut associated with each command let me show you each command let me show you each command let me show you so here we have all the commands when a so here we have all the commands when a so here we have all the commands when a cell is in the command mode for example cell is in the command mode for example cell is in the command mode for example we have this command open the command we have this command open the command we have this command open the command palette this is exactly like the command palette this is exactly like the command palette this is exactly like the command palette that we have in vs code here's a palette that we have in vs code here's a palette that we have in vs code here's a shortcut to execute this command that is shortcut to execute this command that is shortcut to execute this command that is command shift and f command shift and f command shift and f okay so here we have okay so here we have okay so here we have lots of shortcuts of course you're not lots of shortcuts of course you're not lots of shortcuts of course you're not going to use all of them all the time going to use all of them all the time going to use all of them all the time but it's good to have a quick look here but it's good to have a quick look here but it's good to have a quick look here to see what is available for you with to see what is available for you with to see what is available for you with this shortcut you can write code much this shortcut you can write code much this shortcut you can write code much faster so let me show you some of the faster so let me show you some of the faster so let me show you some of the most useful ones most useful ones most useful ones i'm going to close this i'm going to close this i'm going to close this now now now with our first cell with our first cell with our first cell in the command mode i'm going to press b in the command mode i'm going to press b in the command mode i'm going to press b and this inserts a new cell below this and this inserts a new cell below this and this inserts a new cell below this cell cell cell we can also go back to our first cell we can also go back to our first cell we can also go back to our first cell press escape now the cell is in the press escape now the cell is in the press escape now the cell is in the command mode we can insert an empty cell command mode we can insert an empty cell command mode we can insert an empty cell above this cell by pressing a above this cell by pressing a above this cell by pressing a so either a or b a for above and b for so either a or b a for above and b for so either a or b a for above and b for below okay now if you don't want this below okay now if you don't want this below okay now if you don't want this cell you can press d twice to delete it cell you can press d twice to delete it cell you can press d twice to delete it like this like this like this now in the cell i'm going to print a now in the cell i'm going to print a now in the cell i'm going to print a hello world message so hello world message so hello world message so print print print hello world hello world hello world now to run the code in this cell we can now to run the code in this cell we can now to run the code in this cell we can click on the run button here click on the run button here click on the run button here so so so here's our print function and right here's our print function and right here's our print function and right below that you can see the output of below that you can see the output of below that you can see the output of this function but note that when you run this function but note that when you run this function but note that when you run a cell this will only execute the code a cell this will only execute the code a cell this will only execute the code in that cell in other words the code in in that cell in other words the code in in that cell in other words the code in other cells will not be executed let me other cells will not be executed let me other cells will not be executed let me show you what i mean so in the cell show you what i mean so in the cell show you what i mean so in the cell below this cell i'm going to delete the below this cell i'm going to delete the below this cell i'm going to delete the call to describe method call to describe method call to describe method instead i'm going to print instead i'm going to print instead i'm going to print ocean ocean ocean now now now i'm going to put the cursor back i'm going to put the cursor back i'm going to put the cursor back in this cell where we print the hello in this cell where we print the hello in this cell where we print the hello world message and run this cell world message and run this cell world message and run this cell so we can see hello world is displayed so we can see hello world is displayed so we can see hello world is displayed here here here but the cell below is still displaying but the cell below is still displaying but the cell below is still displaying the described table so we don't see the the described table so we don't see the the described table so we don't see the changes here changes here changes here now to solve this problem we can go to now to solve this problem we can go to now to solve this problem we can go to the cell menu on the top and run all the cell menu on the top and run all the cell menu on the top and run all cells together cells together cells together this can work for small projects but this can work for small projects but this can work for small projects but sometimes you're working with a large sometimes you're working with a large sometimes you're working with a large data set so if you want to run all these data set so if you want to run all these data set so if you want to run all these cells together it's going to take a lot cells together it's going to take a lot cells together it's going to take a lot of time that is the reason jupiter saves of time that is the reason jupiter saves of time that is the reason jupiter saves the output of itself so we don't have to the output of itself so we don't have to the output of itself so we don't have to rerun that code if it hasn't changed rerun that code if it hasn't changed rerun that code if it hasn't changed so this notebook file that we have here so this notebook file that we have here so this notebook file that we have here includes our source code organized in includes our source code organized in includes our source code organized in cells as well as the output for each cells as well as the output for each cells as well as the output for each cell that is why it's different from a cell that is why it's different from a cell that is why it's different from a regular pi file where we only have the regular pi file where we only have the regular pi file where we only have the source code source code source code here we also have auto completion and here we also have auto completion and here we also have auto completion and intellisense so in the cell intellisense so in the cell intellisense so in the cell let's call df dataframe let's call df dataframe let's call df dataframe dot now if you press tab we can see all dot now if you press tab we can see all dot now if you press tab we can see all the attributes and methods in this the attributes and methods in this the attributes and methods in this object object object so so so let's call describe let's call describe let's call describe now with the cursor on the name of the now with the cursor on the name of the now with the cursor on the name of the method we can press shift and tab method we can press shift and tab method we can press shift and tab to see this tooltip that describes what to see this tooltip that describes what to see this tooltip that describes what this method does and what parameter it this method does and what parameter it this method does and what parameter it takes so here in front of signature you takes so here in front of signature you takes so here in front of signature you can see the described method these are can see the described method these are can see the described method these are the parameters and their default value the parameters and their default value the parameters and their default value and right below that you can see the and right below that you can see the and right below that you can see the description of what this method does description of what this method does description of what this method does in this case it generates descriptive in this case it generates descriptive in this case it generates descriptive statistics that summarize the central statistics that summarize the central statistics that summarize the central tendency and so on tendency and so on tendency and so on similar to vs code we can also convert a similar to vs code we can also convert a similar to vs code we can also convert a line to comment by pressing command and line to comment by pressing command and line to comment by pressing command and slash on mac or control slash on windows slash on mac or control slash on windows slash on mac or control slash on windows like this like this like this now this line is a comment we can press now this line is a comment we can press now this line is a comment we can press the same shortcut one more time the same shortcut one more time the same shortcut one more time to remove the comment to remove the comment to remove the comment so these were some of the most useful so these were some of the most useful so these were some of the most useful shortcuts in jupyter now over the next shortcuts in jupyter now over the next shortcuts in jupyter now over the next few lectures we're going to work on a few lectures we're going to work on a few lectures we're going to work on a real machine learning project but before real machine learning project but before real machine learning project but before we get there let's delete all the cells we get there let's delete all the cells we get there let's delete all the cells here so we start with only a single here so we start with only a single here so we start with only a single empty cell so here in this cell first empty cell so here in this cell first empty cell so here in this cell first i'm going to press the escape button now i'm going to press the escape button now i'm going to press the escape button now the cell is blue so we are in the the cell is blue so we are in the the cell is blue so we are in the command mode and we can delete the cell command mode and we can delete the cell command mode and we can delete the cell by pressing d twice by pressing d twice by pressing d twice there you go now the next cell is there you go now the next cell is there you go now the next cell is activated and it's in the command mode activated and it's in the command mode activated and it's in the command mode so let's delete this as well so let's delete this as well so let's delete this as well we have two more cells to delete there we have two more cells to delete there we have two more cells to delete there you go you go you go and the last one and the last one and the last one like this like this like this so now we have an empty notebook with a so now we have an empty notebook with a so now we have an empty notebook with a single cell over the next few lectures we're going over the next few lectures we're going over the next few lectures we're going to work on a real machine learning to work on a real machine learning to work on a real machine learning project imagine we have an online music project imagine we have an online music project imagine we have an online music store store store when our users sign up we ask their age when our users sign up we ask their age when our users sign up we ask their age and gender and based on their profile we and gender and based on their profile we and gender and based on their profile we recommend various music albums they're recommend various music albums they're recommend various music albums they're likely to buy so in this project we want likely to buy so in this project we want likely to buy so in this project we want to use machine learning to increase to use machine learning to increase to use machine learning to increase sales sales sales so we want to build a model we feed this so we want to build a model we feed this so we want to build a model we feed this model with some sample data based on the model with some sample data based on the model with some sample data based on the existing users our model will learn the existing users our model will learn the existing users our model will learn the patterns in our data so we can ask it to patterns in our data so we can ask it to patterns in our data so we can ask it to make predictions when a new user signs make predictions when a new user signs make predictions when a new user signs up we tell our model hey we have a new up we tell our model hey we have a new up we tell our model hey we have a new user with this profile what is the kind user with this profile what is the kind user with this profile what is the kind of music that this user is interested in of music that this user is interested in of music that this user is interested in our model will say jazz or hip hop or our model will say jazz or hip hop or our model will say jazz or hip hop or whatever and based on that we can make whatever and based on that we can make whatever and based on that we can make suggestions to the user suggestions to the user suggestions to the user so this is the problem we're going to so this is the problem we're going to so this is the problem we're going to solve solve solve now back to the list of steps in a now back to the list of steps in a now back to the list of steps in a machine learning project machine learning project machine learning project first we need to import our data then we first we need to import our data then we first we need to import our data then we should prepare or clean it next we should prepare or clean it next we should prepare or clean it next we select a machine learning algorithm to select a machine learning algorithm to select a machine learning algorithm to build a model we train our model and ask build a model we train our model and ask build a model we train our model and ask it to make predictions and finally we it to make predictions and finally we it to make predictions and finally we evaluate our algorithm to see its evaluate our algorithm to see its evaluate our algorithm to see its accuracy if it's not accurate we either accuracy if it's not accurate we either accuracy if it's not accurate we either fine tune our model or select a fine tune our model or select a fine tune our model or select a different algorithm so let's focus on different algorithm so let's focus on different algorithm so let's focus on the first step head over to bit.li the first step head over to bit.li the first step head over to bit.li music csv this is a very basic csv that music csv this is a very basic csv that music csv this is a very basic csv that i've created for this project it's just i've created for this project it's just i've created for this project it's just some random made-up data it's not real some random made-up data it's not real some random made-up data it's not real so we have a table with three columns so we have a table with three columns so we have a table with three columns age age age gender and genre gender can either be gender and genre gender can either be gender and genre gender can either be one which represents a male or zero one which represents a male or zero one which represents a male or zero which represents a female here i'm which represents a female here i'm which represents a female here i'm making a few assumptions i'm assuming making a few assumptions i'm assuming making a few assumptions i'm assuming that men between 20 and 25 like hip-hop that men between 20 and 25 like hip-hop that men between 20 and 25 like hip-hop men between 26 and 30 like jazz and men between 26 and 30 like jazz and men between 26 and 30 like jazz and after the age of 30 they like classical after the age of 30 they like classical after the age of 30 they like classical music music music for women i'm assuming that if they're for women i'm assuming that if they're for women i'm assuming that if they're between 20 and 25 they like dance music between 20 and 25 they like dance music between 20 and 25 they like dance music if they're between 26 and 30 they like if they're between 26 and 30 they like if they're between 26 and 30 they like acoustic music and just like men after acoustic music and just like men after acoustic music and just like men after the age of 30 they like classical music the age of 30 they like classical music the age of 30 they like classical music once again this is a made-up pattern once again this is a made-up pattern once again this is a made-up pattern it's not the representation of the it's not the representation of the it's not the representation of the reality reality reality so let's go ahead and download this csv so let's go ahead and download this csv so let's go ahead and download this csv click on this dot dot icon here and click on this dot dot icon here and click on this dot dot icon here and download this file download this file download this file in my downloads folder here we have this in my downloads folder here we have this in my downloads folder here we have this music.csv music.csv music.csv i'm going to drag and drop this onto i'm going to drag and drop this onto i'm going to drag and drop this onto desktop because that's where i've stored desktop because that's where i've stored desktop because that's where i've stored this hello world notebook so i want you this hello world notebook so i want you this hello world notebook so i want you to put the csv file right next to your to put the csv file right next to your to put the csv file right next to your jupyter notebook jupyter notebook jupyter notebook now back to our notebook we need to read now back to our notebook we need to read now back to our notebook we need to read the csv file so just like before first the csv file so just like before first the csv file so just like before first we need to import the pandas module so we need to import the pandas module so we need to import the pandas module so import pandas as pd import pandas as pd import pandas as pd and then we'll call pd that read and then we'll call pd that read and then we'll call pd that read underline csv underline csv underline csv and the name of our file is music.csv and the name of our file is music.csv and the name of our file is music.csv as you saw earlier this returns a data as you saw earlier this returns a data as you saw earlier this returns a data frame which is a two-dimensional array frame which is a two-dimensional array frame which is a two-dimensional array similar to an excel spreadsheet so let's similar to an excel spreadsheet so let's similar to an excel spreadsheet so let's call that music call that music call that music underline data underline data underline data now let's inspect this music underline now let's inspect this music underline now let's inspect this music underline data to make sure we loaded everything data to make sure we loaded everything data to make sure we loaded everything properly so run properly so run properly so run so here's our data frame beautiful next so here's our data frame beautiful next so here's our data frame beautiful next we need to prepare or clean the data and we need to prepare or clean the data and we need to prepare or clean the data and that's the topic for the next lecture the second step in a machine learning the second step in a machine learning the second step in a machine learning project is cleaning or preparing the project is cleaning or preparing the project is cleaning or preparing the data and that involves tasks such as data and that involves tasks such as data and that involves tasks such as removing duplicates null values and so removing duplicates null values and so removing duplicates null values and so on now in this particular data set we on now in this particular data set we on now in this particular data set we don't have to do any kind of cleaning don't have to do any kind of cleaning don't have to do any kind of cleaning because we don't have any duplicates and because we don't have any duplicates and because we don't have any duplicates and as you can see all rows have values for as you can see all rows have values for as you can see all rows have values for all columns so we don't have null values all columns so we don't have null values all columns so we don't have null values but there is one thing we need to do but there is one thing we need to do but there is one thing we need to do we should split this data set into two we should split this data set into two we should split this data set into two separate data sets separate data sets separate data sets one with the first two columns which we one with the first two columns which we one with the first two columns which we refer to as the input set and the other refer to as the input set and the other refer to as the input set and the other with the last column which we refer to with the last column which we refer to with the last column which we refer to as the output set so when we train a as the output set so when we train a as the output set so when we train a model we give it two separate data sets model we give it two separate data sets model we give it two separate data sets the input set and the output set the the input set and the output set the the input set and the output set the output set which is in this case the output set which is in this case the output set which is in this case the genre column contains the predictions so genre column contains the predictions so genre column contains the predictions so we're telling our model that if we have we're telling our model that if we have we're telling our model that if we have a user who's 20 years old and is a male a user who's 20 years old and is a male a user who's 20 years old and is a male they like hip hop they like hip hop they like hip hop once we train our model then we give it once we train our model then we give it once we train our model then we give it a new input set for example we say hey a new input set for example we say hey a new input set for example we say hey we have a new user who is 21 years old we have a new user who is 21 years old we have a new user who is 21 years old and is a male what is the genre of the and is a male what is the genre of the and is a male what is the genre of the music that this user probably likes as music that this user probably likes as music that this user probably likes as you can see in our input set we don't you can see in our input set we don't you can see in our input set we don't have a sample for a 21 year old male so have a sample for a 21 year old male so have a sample for a 21 year old male so we're going to ask our model to predict we're going to ask our model to predict we're going to ask our model to predict that that that that is the reason we need to split this that is the reason we need to split this that is the reason we need to split this data set into two separate sets input data set into two separate sets input data set into two separate sets input and output and output and output so back to our code so back to our code so back to our code this data frame object has a method this data frame object has a method this data frame object has a method called drop called drop called drop now now now if you put the cursor under method name if you put the cursor under method name if you put the cursor under method name and press shift and tab and press shift and tab and press shift and tab you can see this tooltip so this is the you can see this tooltip so this is the you can see this tooltip so this is the signature of this drop method these are signature of this drop method these are signature of this drop method these are the parameters that we can pass here the parameters that we can pass here the parameters that we can pass here the parameter we're going to use in this the parameter we're going to use in this the parameter we're going to use in this lecture is columns which is set to none lecture is columns which is set to none lecture is columns which is set to none by default with this parameter we can by default with this parameter we can by default with this parameter we can specify the columns we want to drop specify the columns we want to drop specify the columns we want to drop so so so in this case we set columns in this case we set columns in this case we set columns to an array with one string genre to an array with one string genre to an array with one string genre now this method doesn't actually modify now this method doesn't actually modify now this method doesn't actually modify the original data set in fact it will the original data set in fact it will the original data set in fact it will create a new data set but without this create a new data set but without this create a new data set but without this column column column so so so by convention we use a capital x to by convention we use a capital x to by convention we use a capital x to represent that data set so capital x represent that data set so capital x represent that data set so capital x equals this expression equals this expression equals this expression now now now let's inspect x let's inspect x let's inspect x so as you can see our input set or x so as you can see our input set or x so as you can see our input set or x includes these two columns age and includes these two columns age and includes these two columns age and gender it doesn't have the output or gender it doesn't have the output or gender it doesn't have the output or predictions predictions predictions next we need to create our output set next we need to create our output set next we need to create our output set so so so once again we start with our data frame once again we start with our data frame once again we start with our data frame music data music data music data using square brackets we can get all the using square brackets we can get all the using square brackets we can get all the values in a given column in this case values in a given column in this case values in a given column in this case genre genre genre once again this returns a new data set once again this returns a new data set once again this returns a new data set by convention we use a lowercase y to by convention we use a lowercase y to by convention we use a lowercase y to represent that so that is our output represent that so that is our output represent that so that is our output data set data set data set let's inspect that as well let's inspect that as well let's inspect that as well so so so in this data set we only have the in this data set we only have the in this data set we only have the predictions or the answers predictions or the answers predictions or the answers so we have prepared our data next we so we have prepared our data next we so we have prepared our data next we need to create a model using an need to create a model using an need to create a model using an algorithm the next step is to build a model using the next step is to build a model using the next step is to build a model using a machine learning algorithm there are a machine learning algorithm there are a machine learning algorithm there are so many algorithms out there and each so many algorithms out there and each so many algorithms out there and each algorithm has its pros and cons in terms algorithm has its pros and cons in terms algorithm has its pros and cons in terms of the performance and accuracy in this of the performance and accuracy in this of the performance and accuracy in this lecture we're going to use a very simple lecture we're going to use a very simple lecture we're going to use a very simple algorithm called decision tree now the algorithm called decision tree now the algorithm called decision tree now the good news is that we don't have to good news is that we don't have to good news is that we don't have to explicitly program these algorithms explicitly program these algorithms explicitly program these algorithms they're already implemented for us in a they're already implemented for us in a they're already implemented for us in a library called scikit-learn library called scikit-learn library called scikit-learn so so so here on the top here on the top here on the top from sklearn.3 let's import the decision let's import the decision let's import the decision tree tree tree classifier classifier classifier so sklearn is the package that comes so sklearn is the package that comes so sklearn is the package that comes with scikit-learn library this is the with scikit-learn library this is the with scikit-learn library this is the most popular machine learning library in most popular machine learning library in most popular machine learning library in python python python in this package we have a module called in this package we have a module called in this package we have a module called tree and in this module we have a class tree and in this module we have a class tree and in this module we have a class called decision tree classifier this called decision tree classifier this called decision tree classifier this class implements the decision tree class implements the decision tree class implements the decision tree algorithm okay algorithm okay algorithm okay so so so now we need to create a new instance of now we need to create a new instance of now we need to create a new instance of this class this class this class so so so at the end let's create an object called at the end let's create an object called at the end let's create an object called model and set it to a new instance of model and set it to a new instance of model and set it to a new instance of decision decision decision tree tree tree classifier classifier classifier like this like this like this so now we have a model next we need to so now we have a model next we need to so now we have a model next we need to train it so it learns patterns in the train it so it learns patterns in the train it so it learns patterns in the data and that is pretty easy we call data and that is pretty easy we call data and that is pretty easy we call model model model that fit that fit that fit this method takes two data sets the this method takes two data sets the this method takes two data sets the input set and the output set input set and the output set input set and the output set so so so they are capital x and y they are capital x and y they are capital x and y and finally we need to ask our model to and finally we need to ask our model to and finally we need to ask our model to make a prediction so we can ask it what make a prediction so we can ask it what make a prediction so we can ask it what is the kind of music that a 21 year old is the kind of music that a 21 year old is the kind of music that a 21 year old male likes now before we do that let's male likes now before we do that let's male likes now before we do that let's temporarily temporarily temporarily inspect our initial data set that is inspect our initial data set that is inspect our initial data set that is music data music data music data so so so look what we got here look what we got here look what we got here as i told you earlier i've assumed that as i told you earlier i've assumed that as i told you earlier i've assumed that men between 20 and 25 like hip-hop music men between 20 and 25 like hip-hop music men between 20 and 25 like hip-hop music but here we only have three samples for but here we only have three samples for but here we only have three samples for men aged 20 men aged 20 men aged 20 23 and 25. we don't have a sample for a 23 and 25. we don't have a sample for a 23 and 25. we don't have a sample for a 21 year old male so if you ask our model 21 year old male so if you ask our model 21 year old male so if you ask our model to predict the kind of music that a 21 to predict the kind of music that a 21 to predict the kind of music that a 21 year old male likes we expect it to say year old male likes we expect it to say year old male likes we expect it to say hip hop hip hop hip hop similarly similarly similarly i've assumed that women between 20 and i've assumed that women between 20 and i've assumed that women between 20 and 25 like dance music but we don't have a 25 like dance music but we don't have a 25 like dance music but we don't have a sample for a 22 year old female so once sample for a 22 year old female so once sample for a 22 year old female so once again if you ask our model to predict again if you ask our model to predict again if you ask our model to predict the kind of music that a 22 year old the kind of music that a 22 year old the kind of music that a 22 year old woman likes we expect it to say dance woman likes we expect it to say dance woman likes we expect it to say dance so so so with these assumptions let's go ahead with these assumptions let's go ahead with these assumptions let's go ahead and ask our model to make predictions and ask our model to make predictions and ask our model to make predictions so let's remove the last line let's remove the last line let's remove the last line and instead we're going to call model and instead we're going to call model and instead we're going to call model dot predict dot predict dot predict this method takes a two dimensional this method takes a two dimensional this method takes a two dimensional array so here's the outer array in this array so here's the outer array in this array so here's the outer array in this array each element is an array so i'm array each element is an array so i'm array each element is an array so i'm going to pass another array here and in going to pass another array here and in going to pass another array here and in this array i'm going to pass a new input this array i'm going to pass a new input this array i'm going to pass a new input set a 21 year old male so 21 comma 1. set a 21 year old male so 21 comma 1. set a 21 year old male so 21 comma 1. that is like a new record that is like a new record that is like a new record in this table in this table in this table okay so this is one input set let's pass okay so this is one input set let's pass okay so this is one input set let's pass another input set for a 22-year female another input set for a 22-year female another input set for a 22-year female so here's another array so here's another array so here's another array here we add 22 comma zero here we add 22 comma zero here we add 22 comma zero so we're asking our model to make two so we're asking our model to make two so we're asking our model to make two predictions at the same time predictions at the same time predictions at the same time we get the result and store it we get the result and store it we get the result and store it in a variable called predictions and in a variable called predictions and in a variable called predictions and finally let's inspect that finally let's inspect that finally let's inspect that in our notebook in our notebook in our notebook run look what we got run look what we got run look what we got our model is saying that a 21 year old our model is saying that a 21 year old our model is saying that a 21 year old male likes hip hop and a 22 year old male likes hip hop and a 22 year old male likes hip hop and a 22 year old female likes dance music female likes dance music female likes dance music so our model could successfully make so our model could successfully make so our model could successfully make predictions here beautiful but wait a predictions here beautiful but wait a predictions here beautiful but wait a second building a model that makes second building a model that makes second building a model that makes predictions accurately is not always predictions accurately is not always predictions accurately is not always that easy as i told you earlier after we that easy as i told you earlier after we that easy as i told you earlier after we build a model we need to measure its build a model we need to measure its build a model we need to measure its accuracy and if it's not accurate enough accuracy and if it's not accurate enough accuracy and if it's not accurate enough we should either fine-tune it or build we should either fine-tune it or build we should either fine-tune it or build the model using a different algorithm so the model using a different algorithm so the model using a different algorithm so in the next lecture i'm going to show in the next lecture i'm going to show in the next lecture i'm going to show you how to measure the accuracy of a you how to measure the accuracy of a you how to measure the accuracy of a model in this lecture i'm going to show you in this lecture i'm going to show you in this lecture i'm going to show you how to measure the accuracy of your how to measure the accuracy of your how to measure the accuracy of your models now in order to do so first we models now in order to do so first we models now in order to do so first we need to split our data set into two sets need to split our data set into two sets need to split our data set into two sets one for training and the other for one for training and the other for one for training and the other for testing because right now we're passing testing because right now we're passing testing because right now we're passing the entire data set for training the the entire data set for training the the entire data set for training the model and we're using two samples for model and we're using two samples for model and we're using two samples for making predictions that is not enough to making predictions that is not enough to making predictions that is not enough to calculate the accuracy of a model a calculate the accuracy of a model a calculate the accuracy of a model a general rule of thumb is to allocate 70 general rule of thumb is to allocate 70 general rule of thumb is to allocate 70 to 80 percent of our data for training to 80 percent of our data for training to 80 percent of our data for training and the other 20 to 30 percent for and the other 20 to 30 percent for and the other 20 to 30 percent for testing then instead of passing only two testing then instead of passing only two testing then instead of passing only two samples for making predictions we can samples for making predictions we can samples for making predictions we can pass the data set we have for testing pass the data set we have for testing pass the data set we have for testing we'll get the predictions and then we we'll get the predictions and then we we'll get the predictions and then we can compare these predictions with the can compare these predictions with the can compare these predictions with the actual values in the test set based on actual values in the test set based on actual values in the test set based on that we can calculate the accuracy that we can calculate the accuracy that we can calculate the accuracy that's really easy all we have to do is that's really easy all we have to do is that's really easy all we have to do is to import a couple of functions and call to import a couple of functions and call to import a couple of functions and call them in this code let me show you so them in this code let me show you so them in this code let me show you so first on the top first on the top first on the top from sklearn from sklearn from sklearn that model underline selection module we that model underline selection module we that model underline selection module we import a function called train test import a function called train test import a function called train test split with this function we can easily split with this function we can easily split with this function we can easily split our data set into two sets for split our data set into two sets for split our data set into two sets for training and testing training and testing training and testing now right here after we define x and y now right here after we define x and y now right here after we define x and y sets we call this function sets we call this function sets we call this function so so so train train train test split test split test split we give it three arguments x we give it three arguments x we give it three arguments x y and a keyword argument that specifies y and a keyword argument that specifies y and a keyword argument that specifies the size of our test data set so test the size of our test data set so test the size of our test data set so test underline size we set it to 0.2 so we underline size we set it to 0.2 so we underline size we set it to 0.2 so we are allocating 20 of our data for are allocating 20 of our data for are allocating 20 of our data for testing testing testing now this function returns a tuple so we now this function returns a tuple so we now this function returns a tuple so we can unpack it into four variables right can unpack it into four variables right can unpack it into four variables right here x underline train here x underline train here x underline train x underline test x underline test x underline test y underline train y underline train y underline train and y underline test and y underline test and y underline test so the first two variables are the input so the first two variables are the input so the first two variables are the input sets for training and testing and the sets for training and testing and the sets for training and testing and the other other other are the output sets for training and are the output sets for training and are the output sets for training and testing testing testing now now now when training our model when training our model when training our model instead of passing the entire data set instead of passing the entire data set instead of passing the entire data set we want to pass only the training data we want to pass only the training data we want to pass only the training data set so set so set so x x x underline train underline train underline train and y and y and y underline train underline train underline train also when making predictions instead of also when making predictions instead of also when making predictions instead of passing these two samples we pass passing these two samples we pass passing these two samples we pass x underline test x underline test x underline test so that is the data set that contains so that is the data set that contains so that is the data set that contains input values for testing input values for testing input values for testing now we get the predictions to calculate now we get the predictions to calculate now we get the predictions to calculate the accuracy we simply have to compare the accuracy we simply have to compare the accuracy we simply have to compare these predictions with the actual values these predictions with the actual values these predictions with the actual values we have in our output set for testing we have in our output set for testing we have in our output set for testing that is very easy first on the top we that is very easy first on the top we that is very easy first on the top we need to import a function need to import a function need to import a function so from sklearn that metrics so from sklearn that metrics so from sklearn that metrics import import import accuracy accuracy accuracy underlying score underlying score underlying score now at the very end we call this now at the very end we call this now at the very end we call this function so accuracy score function so accuracy score function so accuracy score and and and give it two arguments y underline test give it two arguments y underline test give it two arguments y underline test which contains the expected values and which contains the expected values and which contains the expected values and predictions predictions predictions which contains the actual values which contains the actual values which contains the actual values now this function returns an accuracy now this function returns an accuracy now this function returns an accuracy score between 0 to 1. so we can store it score between 0 to 1. so we can store it score between 0 to 1. so we can store it here here here and simply display it on the console and simply display it on the console and simply display it on the console so let's go ahead and run this program so let's go ahead and run this program so let's go ahead and run this program so the accuracy score is one or a so the accuracy score is one or a so the accuracy score is one or a hundred percent but if we run this one hundred percent but if we run this one hundred percent but if we run this one more time we're going to see a different more time we're going to see a different more time we're going to see a different result because every time we split our result because every time we split our result because every time we split our data set into training and test sets data set into training and test sets data set into training and test sets will have different data sets because will have different data sets because will have different data sets because this function randomly picks data for this function randomly picks data for this function randomly picks data for training and testing training and testing training and testing let me show you so put the cursor in the let me show you so put the cursor in the let me show you so put the cursor in the cell now you can see this cell is cell now you can see this cell is cell now you can see this cell is activated note that if you click this activated note that if you click this activated note that if you click this button here it will run this cell and button here it will run this cell and button here it will run this cell and also insert a new cell below this cell also insert a new cell below this cell also insert a new cell below this cell let me show you so if i go to the second let me show you so if i go to the second let me show you so if i go to the second cell cell cell press escape button press escape button press escape button now we are in the command mode press d now we are in the command mode press d now we are in the command mode press d twice twice twice okay now it's deleted okay now it's deleted okay now it's deleted if we click the run button if we click the run button if we click the run button you can see this code was executed and you can see this code was executed and you can see this code was executed and now we have a new cell now we have a new cell now we have a new cell so if you want to run our first cell so if you want to run our first cell so if you want to run our first cell multiple times every time we have to multiple times every time we have to multiple times every time we have to click this and then run it and then click this and then run it and then click this and then run it and then click again and run it it's a little bit click again and run it it's a little bit click again and run it it's a little bit tedious so i'll show you a shortcut tedious so i'll show you a shortcut tedious so i'll show you a shortcut activate the first cell activate the first cell activate the first cell and press ctrl and enter and press ctrl and enter and press ctrl and enter this runs the current cell without this runs the current cell without this runs the current cell without adding a new cell below it so back here adding a new cell below it so back here adding a new cell below it so back here let's try it multiple times okay now let's try it multiple times okay now let's try it multiple times okay now look the accuracy dropped to 0.75 it's look the accuracy dropped to 0.75 it's look the accuracy dropped to 0.75 it's still good so the accuracy score here is still good so the accuracy score here is still good so the accuracy score here is somewhere between 75 percent to 100 somewhere between 75 percent to 100 somewhere between 75 percent to 100 but let me show you something but let me show you something but let me show you something if i change the test size from 0.2 if i change the test size from 0.2 if i change the test size from 0.2 to 0.8 so essentially we're using only to 0.8 so essentially we're using only to 0.8 so essentially we're using only 20 of our data for training this model 20 of our data for training this model 20 of our data for training this model and we're using the other 80 and we're using the other 80 and we're using the other 80 for testing now let's see what happens for testing now let's see what happens for testing now let's see what happens when we run this cell multiple times so when we run this cell multiple times so when we run this cell multiple times so control and enter control and enter control and enter look the accuracy immediately dropped to look the accuracy immediately dropped to look the accuracy immediately dropped to 0.4 one more time 0.4 one more time 0.4 one more time now 46 percent 40 now 46 percent 40 now 46 percent 40 it's really really bad it's really really bad it's really really bad the reason this is happening is because the reason this is happening is because the reason this is happening is because we are using very little data for we are using very little data for we are using very little data for training this model this is one of the training this model this is one of the training this model this is one of the key concepts in machine learning the key concepts in machine learning the key concepts in machine learning the more data we give to our model and the more data we give to our model and the more data we give to our model and the cleaner the data is we get the better cleaner the data is we get the better cleaner the data is we get the better result so if you have duplicates result so if you have duplicates result so if you have duplicates irrelevant data or incomplete values our irrelevant data or incomplete values our irrelevant data or incomplete values our model will learn bad patterns in our model will learn bad patterns in our model will learn bad patterns in our data that is why it's really important data that is why it's really important data that is why it's really important to clean our data before training our to clean our data before training our to clean our data before training our model model model now let's change this back to 0.2 now let's change this back to 0.2 now let's change this back to 0.2 run this one more time run this one more time run this one more time okay now the accuracy is one okay now the accuracy is one okay now the accuracy is one seventy-five percent seventy-five percent seventy-five percent now we drop to fifty percent again the now we drop to fifty percent again the now we drop to fifty percent again the reason this is happening is because we reason this is happening is because we reason this is happening is because we don't have enough data some machine don't have enough data some machine don't have enough data some machine learning problems require thousands or learning problems require thousands or learning problems require thousands or even millions of samples to train a even millions of samples to train a even millions of samples to train a model the more complex the problem is model the more complex the problem is model the more complex the problem is the more data we need for example here the more data we need for example here the more data we need for example here we're only dealing with a table of three we're only dealing with a table of three we're only dealing with a table of three columns but if you want to build a model columns but if you want to build a model columns but if you want to build a model to tell if a picture is a cat or a dog to tell if a picture is a cat or a dog to tell if a picture is a cat or a dog or a horse or a lion we'll need millions or a horse or a lion we'll need millions or a horse or a lion we'll need millions of pictures the more animals we want to of pictures the more animals we want to of pictures the more animals we want to support the more pictures we need in the support the more pictures we need in the support the more pictures we need in the next lecture we're going to talk about next lecture we're going to talk about next lecture we're going to talk about model persistence so this is a very basic implementation so this is a very basic implementation so this is a very basic implementation of building and training a model to make of building and training a model to make of building and training a model to make predictions predictions predictions now to simplify things i have removed now to simplify things i have removed now to simplify things i have removed all the code that we wrote in the last all the code that we wrote in the last all the code that we wrote in the last lecture for calculating the accuracy lecture for calculating the accuracy lecture for calculating the accuracy because in this lecture we're going to because in this lecture we're going to because in this lecture we're going to focus on a different topic focus on a different topic focus on a different topic so basically so basically so basically we import our data set we import our data set we import our data set create a model create a model create a model train it and then ask it to make train it and then ask it to make train it and then ask it to make predictions predictions predictions now this piece of code that you see here now this piece of code that you see here now this piece of code that you see here is not what we want to run every time we is not what we want to run every time we is not what we want to run every time we have a new user or every time we want to have a new user or every time we want to have a new user or every time we want to make recommendations to an existing user make recommendations to an existing user make recommendations to an existing user because training a model can sometimes because training a model can sometimes because training a model can sometimes be really time consuming in this example be really time consuming in this example be really time consuming in this example we're dealing with a very small data set we're dealing with a very small data set we're dealing with a very small data set that has only 20 records but in real that has only 20 records but in real that has only 20 records but in real applications we might have a data set applications we might have a data set applications we might have a data set with thousands or millions of samples with thousands or millions of samples with thousands or millions of samples training a model for that might take training a model for that might take training a model for that might take seconds minutes or even hours so that is seconds minutes or even hours so that is seconds minutes or even hours so that is why model persistence is important once why model persistence is important once why model persistence is important once in a while we build and train our model in a while we build and train our model in a while we build and train our model and then we'll save it to a file now and then we'll save it to a file now and then we'll save it to a file now next time we want to make predictions we next time we want to make predictions we next time we want to make predictions we simply load the model from the file and simply load the model from the file and simply load the model from the file and ask it to make predictions that model is ask it to make predictions that model is ask it to make predictions that model is already trained we don't need to retrain already trained we don't need to retrain already trained we don't need to retrain it it's like an intelligent person so it it's like an intelligent person so it it's like an intelligent person so let me show you how to do this it's very let me show you how to do this it's very let me show you how to do this it's very very easy very easy very easy on the top from on the top from on the top from sklearn.externals sklearn.externals sklearn.externals module module module we import we import we import joblib joblib joblib this joblib object has methods for this joblib object has methods for this joblib object has methods for saving and loading models saving and loading models saving and loading models so so so after we train our model we simply call after we train our model we simply call after we train our model we simply call joblib.dump and give it to arguments and give it to arguments and give it to arguments our model our model our model and

trained model in a file so a file so a file so let's run the cell with control and let's run the cell with control and let's run the cell with control and slash slash slash okay okay okay look look look in the output we have an array that in the output we have an array that in the output we have an array that contains the name of our model file so contains the name of our model file so contains the name of our model file so this is the return value of the dump this is the return value of the dump this is the return value of the dump method method method now back to our desktop right next to my now back to our desktop right next to my now back to our desktop right next to my notebook you can see our job live file notebook you can see our job live file notebook you can see our job live

jupyter notebook as i now back to our jupyter notebook as i now back to our jupyter notebook as i told you before in a real application we told you before in a real application we told you before in a real application we don't want to train a model every time don't want to train a model every time don't want to train a model every time so so so let's comment out these few lines so let's comment out these few lines so let's comment out these few lines so i've selected these few lines on mac we i've selected these few lines on mac we i've selected these few lines on mac we can press command and slash on windows can press command and slash on windows can press command and slash on windows control slash control slash control slash okay these lines are commented out now okay these lines are commented out now okay these lines are commented out now this time instead of dumping our model this time instead of dumping our model this time instead of dumping our model we're going to load it so we call the we're going to load it so we call the we're going to load it so we call the load method load method load method we don't have the model we simply pass we don't have the model we simply pass we don't have the model we simply pass the name of our model file this returns the name of our model file this returns the name of our model file this returns our trained model our trained model our trained model now with these two lines we can simply now with these two lines we can simply now with these two lines we can simply make predictions so make predictions so make predictions so earlier we assumed that men between 20 earlier we assumed that men between 20 earlier we assumed that men between 20 and 25 like hip-hop music and 25 like hip-hop music and 25 like hip-hop music let's print predictions and see if our let's print predictions and see if our let's print predictions and see if our model is behaving correctly or not model is behaving correctly or not model is behaving correctly or not so ctrl and enter there you go so ctrl and enter there you go so ctrl and enter there you go so this is how we persist and load so this is how we persist and load so this is how we persist and load models earlier in this section i told you that earlier in this section i told you that earlier in this section i told you that decision trees are the easiest to decision trees are the easiest to decision trees are the easiest to understand and that's why we started understand and that's why we started understand and that's why we started machine learning with decision trees in machine learning with decision trees in machine learning with decision trees in this lecture we're going to export our this lecture we're going to export our this lecture we're going to export our model in a visual format so you will see model in a visual format so you will see model in a visual format so you will see how this model makes predictions that is how this model makes predictions that is how this model makes predictions that is really really cool let me show you really really cool let me show you really really cool let me show you so so so once again i've simplified this code so once again i've simplified this code so once again i've simplified this code so we simply import our data set we simply import our data set we simply import our data set create create create input and output sets input and output sets input and output sets create a model and train it that's all create a model and train it that's all create a model and train it that's all we are doing we are doing we are doing now i want you to follow along with me now i want you to follow along with me now i want you to follow along with me type everything exactly as i show you in type everything exactly as i show you in type everything exactly as i show you in this lecture don't worry about what this lecture don't worry about what this lecture don't worry about what everything means we're going to come everything means we're going to come everything means we're going to come back to it shortly back to it shortly back to it shortly so on the top so on the top so on the top from sklearn from sklearn from sklearn import tree import tree import tree this object has a method for exporting this object has a method for exporting this object has a method for exporting our decision tree in a graphical format our decision tree in a graphical format our decision tree in a graphical format so after we train our model so after we train our model so after we train our model let's call tree let's call tree let's call tree dot export underline graph viz dot export underline graph viz dot export underline graph viz now here are a few arguments we need to now here are a few arguments we need to now here are a few arguments we need to pass the first argument is our model pass the first argument is our model pass the first argument is our model the second is the name of the output the second is the name of the output the second is the name of the output file so here we're going to use keyword file so here we're going to use keyword file so here we're going to use keyword arguments because this method takes so arguments because this method takes so arguments because this method takes so many parameters and we want to many parameters and we want to many parameters and we want to selectively pass keyword arguments selectively pass keyword arguments selectively pass keyword arguments without worrying about their order without worrying about their order without worrying about their order so so so the parameter we're going to set is out the parameter we're going to set is out the parameter we're going to set is out underline file underline file underline file let's set this to let's set this to let's set this to music dash recommender music dash recommender music dash recommender dot dot this is the dot format which is dot dot this is the dot format which is dot dot this is the dot format which is a graph description language you'll see a graph description language you'll see a graph description language you'll see that shortly that shortly that shortly the other parameter we want to set the other parameter we want to set the other parameter we want to set is feature underline names we set this is feature underline names we set this is feature underline names we set this to an array of two strings to an array of two strings to an array of two strings age age age and gender these are the features or the and gender these are the features or the and gender these are the features or the columns of our data set so they are the columns of our data set so they are the columns of our data set so they are the properties or features of our data okay properties or features of our data okay properties or features of our data okay the other parameter the other parameter the other parameter is class names so class underline names is class names so class underline names is class names so class underline names we should set this to the list of we should set this to the list of we should set this to the list of classes or labels we have in our output classes or labels we have in our output classes or labels we have in our output data set like hip hop jazz classical and data set like hip hop jazz classical and data set like hip hop jazz classical and so on so on so on so this white data set includes all the so this white data set includes all the so this white data set includes all the genres or all the classes of our data genres or all the classes of our data genres or all the classes of our data but they're repeated a few times in this but they're repeated a few times in this but they're repeated a few times in this data set so data set so data set so here we call y dot unique here we call y dot unique here we call y dot unique this returns the unique list of classes this returns the unique list of classes this returns the unique list of classes now we should sort this alphabetically now we should sort this alphabetically now we should sort this alphabetically so we call the sorted function so we call the sorted function so we call the sorted function and pass the result a y dot unique and pass the result a y dot unique and pass the result a y dot unique the next parameter the next parameter the next parameter is label is label is label we set this to a string all we set this to a string all we set this to a string all once again don't worry about the details once again don't worry about the details once again don't worry about the details of these parameters we're going to come of these parameters we're going to come of these parameters we're going to come back to this shortly so set label to all back to this shortly so set label to all back to this shortly so set label to all then round it then round it then round it to true and finally to true and finally to true and finally filled to true filled to true filled to true so this is the end result so this is the end result so this is the end result now let's run this cell using ctrl and now let's run this cell using ctrl and now let's run this cell using ctrl and enter enter enter okay okay okay here we have a new file music here we have a new file music here we have a new file music recommender dot dot that's a little bit recommender dot dot that's a little bit recommender dot dot that's a little bit funny so we want to open this file with funny so we want to open this file with funny so we want to open this file with vs code so drag and drop this into a vs vs code so drag and drop this into a vs vs code so drag and drop this into a vs code window okay here is a dot format it's a textual okay here is a dot format it's a textual okay here is a dot format it's a textual language for describing graphs language for describing graphs language for describing graphs now to visualize this graph we need to now to visualize this graph we need to now to visualize this graph we need to install an extension in vs code so on install an extension in vs code so on install an extension in vs code so on the left side click the extensions panel the left side click the extensions panel the left side click the extensions panel and search for dot d o t and search for dot d o t and search for dot d o t look at the second extension here look at the second extension here look at the second extension here graphviz or dot language graphviz or dot language graphviz or dot language by staphon vs by staphon vs by staphon vs go ahead and install this extension and go ahead and install this extension and go ahead and install this extension and then reload vs code once you do that you then reload vs code once you do that you then reload vs code once you do that you can visualize this dot file so let me can visualize this dot file so let me can visualize this dot file so let me close this tab close this tab close this tab all right all right all right look at this dot dot here on the right look at this dot dot here on the right look at this dot dot here on the right side click this you should have a new side click this you should have a new side click this you should have a new menu open preview to the site so click menu open preview to the site so click menu open preview to the site so click that that that all right here's the visualization of all right here's the visualization of all right here's the visualization of our decision tree let's close the dot our decision tree let's close the dot our decision tree let's close the dot file file file there you go this is exactly how our there you go this is exactly how our there you go this is exactly how our model makes predictions so we have this model makes predictions so we have this model makes predictions so we have this binary tree which means every node can binary tree which means every node can binary tree which means every node can have a maximum of two children on top of have a maximum of two children on top of have a maximum of two children on top of each node we have a condition if this each node we have a condition if this each node we have a condition if this condition is true we go to the child condition is true we go to the child condition is true we go to the child node on the left side otherwise we go to node on the left side otherwise we go to node on the left side otherwise we go to the child node on the right side so the child node on the right side so the child node on the right side so let's see what's happening here let's see what's happening here let's see what's happening here the first condition is age less than or the first condition is age less than or the first condition is age less than or equal to 30.5 if this condition is false equal to 30.5 if this condition is false equal to 30.5 if this condition is false that means that user is 30 years or that means that user is 30 years or that means that user is 30 years or older so the genre of the music that older so the genre of the music that older so the genre of the music that they're interested in is classical they're interested in is classical they're interested in is classical so here we're classifying people based so here we're classifying people based so here we're classifying people based on their profile that is the reason we on their profile that is the reason we on their profile that is the reason we have the word class here so a user who have the word class here so a user who have the word class here so a user who is 30 years or older belongs to the is 30 years or older belongs to the is 30 years or older belongs to the class of classical class of classical class of classical or people who like classical music or people who like classical music or people who like classical music now what if this condition is true that now what if this condition is true that now what if this condition is true that means that user is younger than 30. so means that user is younger than 30. so means that user is younger than 30. so now we check the gender now we check the gender now we check the gender if it's less than 0.5 which basically if it's less than 0.5 which basically if it's less than 0.5 which basically means if it equals to zero then we're means if it equals to zero then we're means if it equals to zero then we're dealing with a female so we go to the dealing with a female so we go to the dealing with a female so we go to the child node here child node here child node here now once again we have another condition now once again we have another condition now once again we have another condition so we're dealing with a female who is so we're dealing with a female who is so we're dealing with a female who is younger than 30. once again we need to younger than 30. once again we need to younger than 30. once again we need to check their age so is the age less than check their age so is the age less than check their age so is the age less than 25.5 if that's the case then that user 25.5 if that's the case then that user 25.5 if that's the case then that user likes dance music otherwise they like likes dance music otherwise they like likes dance music otherwise they like acoustic music acoustic music acoustic music so this is the decision tree that our so this is the decision tree that our so this is the decision tree that our model uses to make predictions now if model uses to make predictions now if model uses to make predictions now if you're wondering why we have these you're wondering why we have these you're wondering why we have these floating point numbers like floating point numbers like floating point numbers like 25.5 these are basically the rules that 25.5 these are basically the rules that 25.5 these are basically the rules that our model generates based on the our model generates based on the our model generates based on the patterns that it finds in our data set patterns that it finds in our data set patterns that it finds in our data set as we give our model more data these as we give our model more data these as we give our model more data these rules will change so they're not always rules will change so they're not always rules will change so they're not always the same also the more columns or more the same also the more columns or more the same also the more columns or more features we have our decision tree is features we have our decision tree is features we have our decision tree is going to get more complex currently we going to get more complex currently we going to get more complex currently we have only two features age and gender have only two features age and gender have only two features age and gender now back to our code let me quickly now back to our code let me quickly now back to our code let me quickly explain the meaning of all these explain the meaning of all these explain the meaning of all these parameters we set fill to true so each parameters we set fill to true so each parameters we set fill to true so each box or each node is filled with a color box or each node is filled with a color box or each node is filled with a color we set rounded to true we set rounded to true we set rounded to true so they have rounded corners so they have rounded corners so they have rounded corners we set label to all we set label to all we set label to all so every node has labels that we can so every node has labels that we can so every node has labels that we can read read read we set class names to the unique list of we set class names to the unique list of we set class names to the unique list of genres and that's for displaying the genres and that's for displaying the genres and that's for displaying the class for each node right here class for each node right here class for each node right here and we set feature names to age and and we set feature names to age and and we set feature names to age and gender so we can see the rules in our gender so we can see the rules in our gender so we can see the rules in our notes so that was a short and sweet so that was a short and sweet so that was a short and sweet introduction to machine learning now you introduction to machine learning now you introduction to machine learning now you can use the materials that you learned can use the materials that you learned can use the materials that you learned in this section and apply them to solve in this section and apply them to solve in this section and apply them to solve a different sort of problems now here's a different sort of problems now here's a different sort of problems now here's a question for you what ideas do you a question for you what ideas do you a question for you what ideas do you have for machine learning what kind of have for machine learning what kind of have for machine learning what kind of problems do you want to solve with problems do you want to solve with problems do you want to solve with machine learning use the comment box machine learning use the comment box machine learning use the comment box below and let me know i love to hear below and let me know i love to hear below and let me know i love to hear about your ideas about your ideas about your ideas next we're going to use python and a next we're going to use python and a next we're going to use python and a popular framework called django to build popular framework called django to build popular framework called django to build a web application are you ready let's a web application are you ready let's a web application are you ready let's get started in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to create your first website with how to create your first website with how to create your first website with python at a very popular framework python at a very popular framework python at a very popular framework called django so it's spelled with a called django so it's spelled with a called django so it's spelled with a silent d and it's pronounced django it's silent d and it's pronounced django it's silent d and it's pronounced django it's a web framework for perfectionists with a web framework for perfectionists with a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines so if you're a perfectionist deadlines so if you're a perfectionist deadlines so if you're a perfectionist and you want to quickly put together a and you want to quickly put together a and you want to quickly put together a website that is fast scalable and secure website that is fast scalable and secure website that is fast scalable and secure django is your best friend django is your best friend django is your best friend and here are the popular websites built and here are the popular websites built and here are the popular websites built with django like instagram spotify with django like instagram spotify with django like instagram spotify youtube washington post and so on now youtube washington post and so on now youtube washington post and so on now you might ask what is a framework and you might ask what is a framework and you might ask what is a framework and why do we need a framework to build a why do we need a framework to build a why do we need a framework to build a web application or a website web application or a website web application or a website well a framework is essentially a well a framework is essentially a well a framework is essentially a library of reusable modules these library of reusable modules these library of reusable modules these modules provide functionality for common modules provide functionality for common modules provide functionality for common tasks for example in case of a web tasks for example in case of a web tasks for example in case of a web framework like django we have modules to framework like django we have modules to framework like django we have modules to work with http requests urls sessions work with http requests urls sessions work with http requests urls sessions cookies and so on these are the concerns cookies and so on these are the concerns cookies and so on these are the concerns of pretty much every website or web of pretty much every website or web of pretty much every website or web application out there so all this application out there so all this application out there so all this functionality is already baked into functionality is already baked into functionality is already baked into django we don't have to code it from django we don't have to code it from django we don't have to code it from scratch that is why we use a framework scratch that is why we use a framework scratch that is why we use a framework like django like django like django now technically a framework is more than now technically a framework is more than now technically a framework is more than a library so apart from providing these a library so apart from providing these a library so apart from providing these modules it also defines a structure for modules it also defines a structure for modules it also defines a structure for our application it tells us what folders our application it tells us what folders our application it tells us what folders and files we should have in our project and files we should have in our project and files we should have in our project so this provides a consistency amongst so this provides a consistency amongst so this provides a consistency amongst various django projects so as you move various django projects so as you move various django projects so as you move from one company to another and work on from one company to another and work on from one company to another and work on different projects you can easily different projects you can easily different projects you can easily transition from one project to another transition from one project to another transition from one project to another because all these applications follow because all these applications follow because all these applications follow the same structure the same structure the same structure now with that introduction let's create now with that introduction let's create now with that introduction let's create our first django project our first django project our first django project so back to pycharm close the hello world so back to pycharm close the hello world so back to pycharm close the hello world project and create a new project project and create a new project project and create a new project okay let's call this new project pi okay let's call this new project pi okay let's call this new project pi shop shop shop go ahead go ahead go ahead all right now down the bottom all right now down the bottom all right now down the bottom let's open up a terminal window let's open up a terminal window let's open up a terminal window in this window we're going to install in this window we're going to install in this window we're going to install django so we use pip to install django django so we use pip to install django django so we use pip to install django but be sure to add two equal signs here but be sure to add two equal signs here but be sure to add two equal signs here followed by 2.1 with this we're telling followed by 2.1 with this we're telling followed by 2.1 with this we're telling pip that we want to install django pip that we want to install django pip that we want to install django version 2.1 the reason i'm doing this is version 2.1 the reason i'm doing this is version 2.1 the reason i'm doing this is because in the future when you're because in the future when you're because in the future when you're watching this video chances are there is watching this video chances are there is watching this video chances are there is a newer version of django out there i a newer version of django out there i a newer version of django out there i want to make sure that you can easily want to make sure that you can easily want to make sure that you can easily follow these tutorials even though what follow these tutorials even though what follow these tutorials even though what i'm going to show you in these tutorials i'm going to show you in these tutorials i'm going to show you in these tutorials will most likely work with the latest will most likely work with the latest will most likely work with the latest version of django i just want to be on version of django i just want to be on version of django i just want to be on the safe side so let's go ahead with the safe side so let's go ahead with the safe side so let's go ahead with this all right django is installed next we all right django is installed next we all right django is installed next we need to create a django project so here need to create a django project so here need to create a django project so here press ctrl and l this cleans up our press ctrl and l this cleans up our press ctrl and l this cleans up our terminal window you don't have to do it terminal window you don't have to do it terminal window you don't have to do it but it's just easier to see but it's just easier to see but it's just easier to see to create a django project we need to to create a django project we need to to create a django project we need to execute this command django execute this command django execute this command django dash admin dash admin dash admin space start space start space start project project project space space space we're going to call this project pi we're going to call this project pi we're going to call this project pi shop shop shop space period space period space period so when we install django django brings so when we install django django brings so when we install django django brings a command line utility called django a command line utility called django a command line utility called django admin so this is a utility or program admin so this is a utility or program admin so this is a utility or program that we can execute from the command that we can execute from the command that we can execute from the command line or terminal right here line or terminal right here line or terminal right here now this program takes various arguments now this program takes various arguments now this program takes various arguments in this case we want to use this in this case we want to use this in this case we want to use this argument start project with this we're argument start project with this we're argument start project with this we're going to create a project called pi shop going to create a project called pi shop going to create a project called pi shop in the current folder so this period is in the current folder so this period is in the current folder so this period is important here that means the current important here that means the current important here that means the current folder folder folder if you don't add this period this if you don't add this period this if you don't add this period this utility is going to create an extra utility is going to create an extra utility is going to create an extra folder and that looks a little bit folder and that looks a little bit folder and that looks a little bit repetitive so let's go ahead with this repetitive so let's go ahead with this repetitive so let's go ahead with this all right all right all right now back to the project panel if you now back to the project panel if you now back to the project panel if you expand pi shop expand pi shop expand pi shop you can see that this is our project you can see that this is our project you can see that this is our project that we created in pycharm and in this that we created in pycharm and in this that we created in pycharm and in this folder we have folder we have folder we have these files these files these files so in it that pi you have seen this so in it that pi you have seen this so in it that pi you have seen this before that means this folder is a before that means this folder is a before that means this folder is a package so we can import various modules package so we can import various modules package so we can import various modules from this package into other modules so from this package into other modules so from this package into other modules so here we have the settings module in this here we have the settings module in this here we have the settings module in this module we defined various settings for module we defined various settings for module we defined various settings for our application you're going to see this our application you're going to see this our application you're going to see this later in this course we also have the later in this course we also have the later in this course we also have the urls module and with this module we urls module and with this module we urls module and with this module we define what should the user see when define what should the user see when define what should the user see when they go to let's say slash about slash they go to let's say slash about slash they go to let's say slash about slash contact slash products contact slash products contact slash products shopping cart again we're going to work shopping cart again we're going to work shopping cart again we're going to work with this zone and finally we have this with this zone and finally we have this with this zone and finally we have this module ws gi that is short for web module ws gi that is short for web module ws gi that is short for web server gateway interface the purpose of server gateway interface the purpose of server gateway interface the purpose of this module is to provide a standard this module is to provide a standard this module is to provide a standard interface between applications built interface between applications built interface between applications built with django and web servers this is an with django and web servers this is an with django and web servers this is an advanced topic so for now don't worry advanced topic so for now don't worry advanced topic so for now don't worry about it about it about it the outside of this folder we also have the outside of this folder we also have the outside of this folder we also have this new file in our project that is this new file in our project that is this new file in our project that is manage.pi manage.pi manage.pi as the name implies we use this module as the name implies we use this module as the name implies we use this module to manage this django project with this to manage this django project with this to manage this django project with this we can start our web server we can work we can start our web server we can work we can start our web server we can work with our database again we're going to with our database again we're going to with our database again we're going to work with this soon work with this soon work with this soon so let's open up the terminal window one so let's open up the terminal window one so let's open up the terminal window one more time more time more time now type out this command python if now type out this command python if now type out this command python if you're on windows or python 3 if you're you're on windows or python 3 if you're you're on windows or python 3 if you're on mac because as i told you at the on mac because as i told you at the on mac because as i told you at the beginning of the course mac by default beginning of the course mac by default beginning of the course mac by default comes with an installation of python comes with an installation of python comes with an installation of python that is python 2. but in this course that is python 2. but in this course that is python 2. but in this course we're using python 3. so python 3 space we're using python 3. so python 3 space we're using python 3. so python 3 space manage dot pi manage dot pi manage dot pi space space space run server run server run server what is going on here so with python what is going on here so with python what is going on here so with python interpreter we are running this program interpreter we are running this program interpreter we are running this program manage.pi and passing run server as an manage.pi and passing run server as an manage.pi and passing run server as an argument this manage.pi is essentially argument this manage.pi is essentially argument this manage.pi is essentially the same program that we worked with the same program that we worked with the same program that we worked with here django admin here django admin here django admin but we use django admin before creating but we use django admin before creating but we use django admin before creating a django project now we have a django a django project now we have a django a django project now we have a django project so in this project we work with project so in this project we work with project so in this project we work with manage.pipe this is a module that manage.pipe this is a module that manage.pipe this is a module that contains some python code so we use this contains some python code so we use this contains some python code so we use this module to manage our django project module to manage our django project module to manage our django project so let's go ahead and run our so let's go ahead and run our so let's go ahead and run our development web server development web server development web server as you can see this started a as you can see this started a as you can see this started a development web server at this address development web server at this address development web server at this address http colon forward slash forward slash http colon forward slash forward slash http colon forward slash forward slash 127.0 0.0.1 that is the address of your 127.0 0.0.1 that is the address of your 127.0 0.0.1 that is the address of your current machine now note that after this current machine now note that after this current machine now note that after this we have colon 8000 unfortunately the we have colon 8000 unfortunately the we have colon 8000 unfortunately the link below this address has a problem as link below this address has a problem as link below this address has a problem as you can see the port is excluded so if you can see the port is excluded so if you can see the port is excluded so if we click this we click this we click this it opens up our web browser and points it opens up our web browser and points it opens up our web browser and points it to this address so we don't have the it to this address so we don't have the it to this address so we don't have the port number let's add colon 8000 at the port number let's add colon 8000 at the port number let's add colon 8000 at the end and here's our first django website so we created this django project so we created this django project so we created this django project now this django project can contain now this django project can contain now this django project can contain multiple apps these apps don't represent multiple apps these apps don't represent multiple apps these apps don't represent the entire application there are small the entire application there are small the entire application there are small functional areas in our django project functional areas in our django project functional areas in our django project here's an example imagine you want to here's an example imagine you want to here's an example imagine you want to build a website or a web application build a website or a web application build a website or a web application like amazon amazon is a big website it like amazon amazon is a big website it like amazon amazon is a big website it has so many different functions instead has so many different functions instead has so many different functions instead of implementing all these functions in a of implementing all these functions in a of implementing all these functions in a django project we divide this project django project we divide this project django project we divide this project into small functional areas that are into small functional areas that are into small functional areas that are focused on one concern for example we focused on one concern for example we focused on one concern for example we could have functional areas like product could have functional areas like product could have functional areas like product management order management customer management order management customer management order management customer management these are completely management these are completely management these are completely different functional areas the functions different functional areas the functions different functional areas the functions we have for managing the customers are we have for managing the customers are we have for managing the customers are different from the functions for different from the functions for different from the functions for managing the products by the same token managing the products by the same token managing the products by the same token when you go to an organization there are when you go to an organization there are when you go to an organization there are small departments or small offices small departments or small offices small departments or small offices specializing in different areas so with specializing in different areas so with specializing in different areas so with this analogy we divide the django this analogy we divide the django this analogy we divide the django project into multiple django apps each project into multiple django apps each project into multiple django apps each app is focused on one functional area app is focused on one functional area app is focused on one functional area so in this tutorial i'm going to show so in this tutorial i'm going to show so in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to add a new app to manage the you how to add a new app to manage the you how to add a new app to manage the products in our imaginary shop in the products in our imaginary shop in the products in our imaginary shop in the future let's say we want to add a blog future let's say we want to add a blog future let's say we want to add a blog to our online shop we could come back to our online shop we could come back to our online shop we could come back here and create a new app that here and create a new app that here and create a new app that represents a blog now the beauty of represents a blog now the beauty of represents a blog now the beauty of these apps is that we can reuse them these apps is that we can reuse them these apps is that we can reuse them across different django projects because across different django projects because across different django projects because each app is essentially a python package each app is essentially a python package each app is essentially a python package let me show you so back to our project let me show you so back to our project let me show you so back to our project let's open up a terminal window let's open up a terminal window let's open up a terminal window so this is the terminal window we opened so this is the terminal window we opened so this is the terminal window we opened earlier where we started our web server earlier where we started our web server earlier where we started our web server now up here we have this plus button for now up here we have this plus button for now up here we have this plus button for creating a new terminal window so let's creating a new terminal window so let's creating a new terminal window so let's click that click that click that now let's type out this command python now let's type out this command python now let's type out this command python on windows or python 3 on mac on windows or python 3 on mac on windows or python 3 on mac manage dot pi so we're using the same manage dot pi so we're using the same manage dot pi so we're using the same program the same module but this time program the same module but this time program the same module but this time with a different argument start app with a different argument start app with a different argument start app and we're going to call that app and we're going to call that app and we're going to call that app products products products let's go ahead all right now let's go ahead all right now let's go ahead all right now here we have a new folder called here we have a new folder called here we have a new folder called products products products let's see what we have in this folder we let's see what we have in this folder we let's see what we have in this folder we have a subfolder called migrations we'll have a subfolder called migrations we'll have a subfolder called migrations we'll look at this later below that we have look at this later below that we have look at this later below that we have this init.pi so products is a package we this init.pi so products is a package we this init.pi so products is a package we can take this package and reuse it in can take this package and reuse it in can take this package and reuse it in another django application or more another django application or more another django application or more specifically django project we can also specifically django project we can also specifically django project we can also publish this package to pi pi for other publish this package to pi pi for other publish this package to pi pi for other people to reuse in their django projects people to reuse in their django projects people to reuse in their django projects for example if someone else wants to for example if someone else wants to for example if someone else wants to build an online shop they can reuse this build an online shop they can reuse this build an online shop they can reuse this package for managing the list of package for managing the list of package for managing the list of products they don't have to build this products they don't have to build this products they don't have to build this functionality from scratch okay we have functionality from scratch okay we have functionality from scratch okay we have this module admin and this is used for this module admin and this is used for this module admin and this is used for defining how the administrative panel of defining how the administrative panel of defining how the administrative panel of this app will look like again we're this app will look like again we're this app will look like again we're going to come back to this later going to come back to this later going to come back to this later below that we have this module apps below that we have this module apps below that we have this module apps unfortunately the name is a little bit unfortunately the name is a little bit unfortunately the name is a little bit confusing because right now we are confusing because right now we are confusing because right now we are inside of one app that is the products inside of one app that is the products inside of one app that is the products app and it doesn't make sense to have a app and it doesn't make sense to have a app and it doesn't make sense to have a module called apps inside of an app so i module called apps inside of an app so i module called apps inside of an app so i don't know why django creators decided don't know why django creators decided don't know why django creators decided to call this module apps but basically to call this module apps but basically to call this module apps but basically we use this module to store various we use this module to store various we use this module to store various configuration settings for this app so configuration settings for this app so configuration settings for this app so it would be better to call this config it would be better to call this config it would be better to call this config but that aside let's move on but that aside let's move on but that aside let's move on next we have models and this is where we next we have models and this is where we next we have models and this is where we define classes or new types for modeling define classes or new types for modeling define classes or new types for modeling the concepts in this app in this domain the concepts in this app in this domain the concepts in this app in this domain for example in the domain of products for example in the domain of products for example in the domain of products you probably have concepts like product you probably have concepts like product you probably have concepts like product category review and so on so we could category review and so on so we could category review and so on so we could model these concepts using classes again model these concepts using classes again model these concepts using classes again we're going to come back to this and we're going to come back to this and we're going to come back to this and define a new class here define a new class here define a new class here next we have tests.pi and this is where next we have tests.pi and this is where next we have tests.pi and this is where we write automated tests for this app we write automated tests for this app we write automated tests for this app that's an advanced topic beyond the that's an advanced topic beyond the that's an advanced topic beyond the scope of this course so don't worry scope of this course so don't worry scope of this course so don't worry about it and finally we have the views about it and finally we have the views about it and finally we have the views module and this is where we define what module and this is where we define what module and this is where we define what should the user see when they navigate should the user see when they navigate should the user see when they navigate to a certain page in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to create your first view or view how to create your first view or view how to create your first view or view function in django what is the view function in django what is the view function in django what is the view function a view function is basically a function a view function is basically a function a view function is basically a function that gets called by django when function that gets called by django when function that gets called by django when the user navigates to a particular page the user navigates to a particular page the user navigates to a particular page for example here we are on the home page for example here we are on the home page for example here we are on the home page of our website of our website of our website when we go to slash products our browser when we go to slash products our browser when we go to slash products our browser sends an http request to our web server sends an http request to our web server sends an http request to our web server at this point django takes that request at this point django takes that request at this point django takes that request it inspects the url or the address it it inspects the url or the address it it inspects the url or the address it figures out that we want to see the list figures out that we want to see the list figures out that we want to see the list of products then it will call a function of products then it will call a function of products then it will call a function which we call a view function and the which we call a view function and the which we call a view function and the job of this function is to return the job of this function is to return the job of this function is to return the response to the browser or to the client response to the browser or to the client response to the browser or to the client so this function should generate some so this function should generate some so this function should generate some html markup to be returned to the client html markup to be returned to the client html markup to be returned to the client our browser will get this html content our browser will get this html content our browser will get this html content and display it as a page right here and display it as a page right here and display it as a page right here now technically if you want to be a web now technically if you want to be a web now technically if you want to be a web developer you need to know html css and developer you need to know html css and developer you need to know html css and javascript i'll try to do my best to javascript i'll try to do my best to javascript i'll try to do my best to hold your hand throughout this course hold your hand throughout this course hold your hand throughout this course but in the future be sure to watch a but in the future be sure to watch a but in the future be sure to watch a tutorial about html css and javascript tutorial about html css and javascript tutorial about html css and javascript on my channel i have plenty of on my channel i have plenty of on my channel i have plenty of javascript tutorials i recommend you to javascript tutorials i recommend you to javascript tutorials i recommend you to start with my javascript tutorial for start with my javascript tutorial for start with my javascript tutorial for beginners beginners beginners so back to our project so back to our project so back to our project inside the products app let's open up inside the products app let's open up inside the products app let's open up the views module so here on the top we have some so here on the top we have some so here on the top we have some boilerplate code from django.shortcuts boilerplate code from django.shortcuts boilerplate code from django.shortcuts we are importing the render function so we are importing the render function so we are importing the render function so django is a package shortcuts is a django is a package shortcuts is a django is a package shortcuts is a module and we are importing the render module and we are importing the render module and we are importing the render function you will see this soon below function you will see this soon below function you will see this soon below that we have this comment we don't need that we have this comment we don't need that we have this comment we don't need it let's create our first view function it let's create our first view function it let's create our first view function so define we call this function index it so define we call this function index it so define we call this function index it doesn't really matter but by convention doesn't really matter but by convention doesn't really matter but by convention we use the word index for the main page we use the word index for the main page we use the word index for the main page of an app of an app of an app so when we go to slash products this so when we go to slash products this so when we go to slash products this will be the main page of our products will be the main page of our products will be the main page of our products app now potentially in the future we app now potentially in the future we app now potentially in the future we could support additional urls inside of could support additional urls inside of could support additional urls inside of this app for example products slash new this app for example products slash new this app for example products slash new or training and so on or training and so on or training and so on so we call this function index so we call this function index so we call this function index now all our view functions should always now all our view functions should always now all our view functions should always take a parameter and take a parameter and take a parameter and that is the http request that is passed that is the http request that is passed that is the http request that is passed to this view function to this view function to this view function so as i told you before when we navigate so as i told you before when we navigate so as i told you before when we navigate to slash products our browser sends an to slash products our browser sends an to slash products our browser sends an http request to our web server django http request to our web server django http request to our web server django takes this request and sends it to our takes this request and sends it to our takes this request and sends it to our view function view function view function with this request object we can find with this request object we can find with this request object we can find information about the client information about the client information about the client now in this tutorial we don't want to now in this tutorial we don't want to now in this tutorial we don't want to worry about html we just want to return worry about html we just want to return worry about html we just want to return some plain text to the browser like some plain text to the browser like some plain text to the browser like hello world so on the top hello world so on the top hello world so on the top from django.httpmodule we need to import a class called http we need to import a class called http we need to import a class called http response response response with this class we can create an http with this class we can create an http with this class we can create an http response to return to the client or the response to return to the client or the response to return to the client or the browser so back to our view function browser so back to our view function browser so back to our view function here we return an http response object here we return an http response object here we return an http response object so we're creating an instance of this so we're creating an instance of this so we're creating an instance of this class right class right class right now as an argument to the constructor we now as an argument to the constructor we now as an argument to the constructor we pass hello world pass hello world pass hello world now we need to add an extra blank line now we need to add an extra blank line now we need to add an extra blank line above the index function to make python above the index function to make python above the index function to make python happy beautiful happy beautiful happy beautiful as simple as that so we are done with this view function so we are done with this view function so we are done with this view function but nowhere django knows that it should but nowhere django knows that it should but nowhere django knows that it should call this function when we send a call this function when we send a call this function when we send a request to slash products request to slash products request to slash products so we need to tell django that hey so we need to tell django that hey so we need to tell django that hey whenever there is a request to slash whenever there is a request to slash whenever there is a request to slash products call this index function we products call this index function we products call this index function we need to map this url to this function need to map this url to this function need to map this url to this function a url is short for uniform a url is short for uniform a url is short for uniform resource locator and that basically resource locator and that basically resource locator and that basically means address means address means address okay okay okay so let's do the mapping we're done with so let's do the mapping we're done with so let's do the mapping we're done with this module close it this module close it this module close it back to our products app right click back to our products app right click back to our products app right click this folder and add a new python file this folder and add a new python file this folder and add a new python file call that urls the name is very call that urls the name is very call that urls the name is very important here this is one of the important here this is one of the important here this is one of the conventions that django framework conventions that django framework conventions that django framework defines so we need to follow this defines so we need to follow this defines so we need to follow this convention to structure our project convention to structure our project convention to structure our project okay so this adds urls.pi inside of the okay so this adds urls.pi inside of the okay so this adds urls.pi inside of the products app now in this module once products app now in this module once products app now in this module once again by convention we should define a again by convention we should define a again by convention we should define a variable called url patterns variable called url patterns variable called url patterns make sure to spell it exactly as you see make sure to spell it exactly as you see make sure to spell it exactly as you see here so there is no underscore between here so there is no underscore between here so there is no underscore between these two words and all characters are these two words and all characters are these two words and all characters are in lower case in lower case in lower case so we set this to a list object so we set this to a list object so we set this to a list object in this list we map various urls to in this list we map various urls to in this list we map various urls to their view functions their view functions their view functions now to reference a url we need to import now to reference a url we need to import now to reference a url we need to import the path function the path function the path function so on the top so on the top so on the top from from from django.urls let's import the path django.urls let's import the path django.urls let's import the path function function function with this function we can map a url to a with this function we can map a url to a with this function we can map a url to a view function so we call the path view function so we call the path view function so we call the path function function function the first argument is a string that the first argument is a string that the first argument is a string that specifies our url endpoint specifies our url endpoint specifies our url endpoint here we pass an empty string that is a here we pass an empty string that is a here we pass an empty string that is a string with no characters in it and this string with no characters in it and this string with no characters in it and this represents the root of this app let me represents the root of this app let me represents the root of this app let me show you what i mean so show you what i mean so show you what i mean so imagine our app starts imagine our app starts imagine our app starts at slash products at slash products at slash products so if the user sends a request to this so if the user sends a request to this so if the user sends a request to this endpoint they will be at the root of endpoint they will be at the root of endpoint they will be at the root of this app potentially here we could have this app potentially here we could have this app potentially here we could have other urls like slash products slash one other urls like slash products slash one other urls like slash products slash one slash detail or slash products slash new slash detail or slash products slash new slash detail or slash products slash new or trending or whatever so all the urls or trending or whatever so all the urls or trending or whatever so all the urls in this app start with slash products in this app start with slash products in this app start with slash products okay now back to the first example okay now back to the first example okay now back to the first example what happens if we take away this slash what happens if we take away this slash what happens if we take away this slash products we are left with nothing and products we are left with nothing and products we are left with nothing and that is why we use an empty string here that is why we use an empty string here that is why we use an empty string here now as the second argument to this now as the second argument to this now as the second argument to this function we need to specify our view function we need to specify our view function we need to specify our view function function function so we defined that view function inside so we defined that view function inside so we defined that view function inside of the views module of the views module of the views module so first we need to import this module so first we need to import this module so first we need to import this module into the urls module into the urls module into the urls module now now now this is how we do this from this is how we do this from this is how we do this from period import views period import views period import views period means the current folder so from period means the current folder so from period means the current folder so from the current folder we are importing the the current folder we are importing the the current folder we are importing the views module views module views module so with this syntax we're telling django so with this syntax we're telling django so with this syntax we're telling django to import the views module that we have to import the views module that we have to import the views module that we have in this folder now you might ask wash in this folder now you might ask wash in this folder now you might ask wash why didn't we import the views module why didn't we import the views module why didn't we import the views module like this import views because views is like this import views because views is like this import views because views is actually in the current folder so why do actually in the current folder so why do actually in the current folder so why do we have to use the from import syntax we have to use the from import syntax we have to use the from import syntax the reason for this is because views is the reason for this is because views is the reason for this is because views is kind of a generic name so it is possible kind of a generic name so it is possible kind of a generic name so it is possible that our project has a dependency to that our project has a dependency to that our project has a dependency to another library called views another library called views another library called views with this syntax python will end up with this syntax python will end up with this syntax python will end up importing that module instead of the importing that module instead of the importing that module instead of the views module in the current folder views module in the current folder views module in the current folder because that will take priority because that will take priority because that will take priority so so so to remove these potential issues we use to remove these potential issues we use to remove these potential issues we use the from import syntax the from import syntax the from import syntax so now we imported the views module as so now we imported the views module as so now we imported the views module as you know when we import a module that you know when we import a module that you know when we import a module that module will end up being an object so we module will end up being an object so we module will end up being an object so we can use the dot operator to access the can use the dot operator to access the can use the dot operator to access the functions defined in that module so here functions defined in that module so here functions defined in that module so here we want to reference the index function we want to reference the index function we want to reference the index function okay let's delete it from here back to okay let's delete it from here back to okay let's delete it from here back to our path function our path function our path function as the second argument we type out as the second argument we type out as the second argument we type out views.index views.index views.index now note that i'm not calling this now note that i'm not calling this now note that i'm not calling this function i'm simply passing a reference function i'm simply passing a reference function i'm simply passing a reference to it django will take care of calling to it django will take care of calling to it django will take care of calling this function at runtime when the client this function at runtime when the client this function at runtime when the client sends an http request to the server so sends an http request to the server so sends an http request to the server so here we should not call this function here we should not call this function here we should not call this function so let's quickly recap what we have done so let's quickly recap what we have done so let's quickly recap what we have done up to this point up to this point up to this point in the views module in the views module in the views module we created this view function and in we created this view function and in we created this view function and in this view function we simply return some this view function we simply return some this view function we simply return some plain text to the browser or the client plain text to the browser or the client plain text to the browser or the client now i told you that nowhere django knows now i told you that nowhere django knows now i told you that nowhere django knows that it should call this function so that it should call this function so that it should call this function so that's why we added the urls module to that's why we added the urls module to that's why we added the urls module to our app our app our app and in this module we mapped the root and in this module we mapped the root and in this module we mapped the root url to this view function url to this view function url to this view function there's one more step left we need to there's one more step left we need to there's one more step left we need to tell django about this app because up to tell django about this app because up to tell django about this app because up to this point django is not aware of this this point django is not aware of this this point django is not aware of this app app app so so so let's collapse the products folder and let's collapse the products folder and let's collapse the products folder and open up the pie shop folder open up the pie shop folder open up the pie shop folder in this folder we have another urls in this folder we have another urls in this folder we have another urls module and this is like the root or the module and this is like the root or the module and this is like the root or the parent urls module in our django project parent urls module in our django project parent urls module in our django project let's open this let's open this let's open this and scroll and scroll and scroll down once again you see this url down once again you see this url down once again you see this url patterns variable that is set to a list patterns variable that is set to a list patterns variable that is set to a list in this list again we're calling the in this list again we're calling the in this list again we're calling the path function path function path function as the first argument we're telling as the first argument we're telling as the first argument we're telling django that hey any urls that start with django that hey any urls that start with django that hey any urls that start with admin delegate them to the admin app so admin delegate them to the admin app so admin delegate them to the admin app so every django project by default comes every django project by default comes every django project by default comes with this admin app which gives us a with this admin app which gives us a with this admin app which gives us a beautiful administrative panel we're beautiful administrative panel we're beautiful administrative panel we're going to work with that soon going to work with that soon going to work with that soon so in this module we should also tell so in this module we should also tell so in this module we should also tell django about our products app so let's django about our products app so let's django about our products app so let's add another object to this list once add another object to this list once add another object to this list once again we call the path function again we call the path function again we call the path function now we tell django that hey any paths or now we tell django that hey any paths or now we tell django that hey any paths or any urls that start with products slash any urls that start with products slash any urls that start with products slash delegate them to the products app delegate them to the products app delegate them to the products app so we want django to delegate the so we want django to delegate the so we want django to delegate the handling of that request handling of that request handling of that request to this urls module that we defined in to this urls module that we defined in to this urls module that we defined in the products app the products app the products app okay how do we do that very easy okay how do we do that very easy okay how do we do that very easy back to the main or the parent urls back to the main or the parent urls back to the main or the parent urls module on line 16 we have this import module on line 16 we have this import module on line 16 we have this import statement let's expand it statement let's expand it statement let's expand it so basically we have two import so basically we have two import so basically we have two import statements look at the second one from statements look at the second one from statements look at the second one from django.urls module we're importing the django.urls module we're importing the django.urls module we're importing the pass function there is another function pass function there is another function pass function there is another function that we need to import and that is the that we need to import and that is the that we need to import and that is the include function include function include function now we're going to use this function on now we're going to use this function on now we're going to use this function on line 21 so as the second argument to the line 21 so as the second argument to the line 21 so as the second argument to the path function we call include path function we call include path function we call include and here we need to reference the urls and here we need to reference the urls and here we need to reference the urls module in the product app so we type out module in the product app so we type out module in the product app so we type out products dot urls products dot urls products dot urls so take a look so take a look so take a look in the products app in the products app in the products app we have this module we have this module we have this module urls that is why we type urls that is why we type urls that is why we type products.urls but we don't type out dot products.urls but we don't type out dot products.urls but we don't type out dot pi django will automatically take care pi django will automatically take care pi django will automatically take care of that of that of that now at this point you might be a little now at this point you might be a little now at this point you might be a little bit confused or intimidated by all these bit confused or intimidated by all these bit confused or intimidated by all these various steps that you have to follow various steps that you have to follow various steps that you have to follow they may look foreign to you but trust they may look foreign to you but trust they may look foreign to you but trust me this becomes second nature as you me this becomes second nature as you me this becomes second nature as you practice building django applications practice building django applications practice building django applications it's actually very easy it's just the it's actually very easy it's just the it's actually very easy it's just the first time that you have to follow these first time that you have to follow these first time that you have to follow these conventions defined in django framework conventions defined in django framework conventions defined in django framework once you understand the concept it once you understand the concept it once you understand the concept it becomes really easy becomes really easy becomes really easy so basically because we created a new so basically because we created a new so basically because we created a new app the products app only once ever we app the products app only once ever we app the products app only once ever we need to write this line of code to tell need to write this line of code to tell need to write this line of code to tell django that hey any urls that start with django that hey any urls that start with django that hey any urls that start with products products products send them to the urls module in the send them to the urls module in the send them to the urls module in the products app products app products app so we write this line of code only once so we write this line of code only once so we write this line of code only once anytime in the future we want to define anytime in the future we want to define anytime in the future we want to define a new view function first we go to the a new view function first we go to the a new view function first we go to the views module we create a new function views module we create a new function views module we create a new function and then we go to the urls module in and then we go to the urls module in and then we go to the urls module in that app that app that app and define a new url pattern to map that and define a new url pattern to map that and define a new url pattern to map that view function to a url endpoint that is view function to a url endpoint that is view function to a url endpoint that is really easy really easy really easy all right now let's test our application all right now let's test our application all right now let's test our application so back to the browser so back to the browser so back to the browser let's head over to slash products let's head over to slash products let's head over to slash products there you go you see our hello world there you go you see our hello world there you go you see our hello world message here beautiful but if we message here beautiful but if we message here beautiful but if we navigate back to the home page navigate back to the home page navigate back to the home page we get this error page not found so our we get this error page not found so our we get this error page not found so our beautiful django homepage disappeared beautiful django homepage disappeared beautiful django homepage disappeared and the reason for this is that that and the reason for this is that that and the reason for this is that that home page is automatically generated and home page is automatically generated and home page is automatically generated and is only displayed when we first create a is only displayed when we first create a is only displayed when we first create a django project django project django project as soon as we define a new url pattern as soon as we define a new url pattern as soon as we define a new url pattern and register it in our project that and register it in our project that and register it in our project that homepage disappears but don't worry homepage disappears but don't worry homepage disappears but don't worry we're going to come back and create a we're going to come back and create a we're going to come back and create a new function for our home page later in new function for our home page later in new function for our home page later in the course the course the course now here is your exercise i want you to now here is your exercise i want you to now here is your exercise i want you to modify this django project such that modify this django project such that modify this django project such that when we navigate to products when we navigate to products when we navigate to products slash new we'll see a page here with slash new we'll see a page here with slash new we'll see a page here with some text like new products i strongly some text like new products i strongly some text like new products i strongly encourage you to do this exercise encourage you to do this exercise encourage you to do this exercise because it makes it really easy for you because it makes it really easy for you because it makes it really easy for you to follow the future tutorials alright here in the products app let's alright here in the products app let's alright here in the products app let's open up the views module open up the views module open up the views module in this module we define a new view in this module we define a new view in this module we define a new view function so define let's call that function so define let's call that function so define let's call that function new function new function new as i told you before every view function as i told you before every view function as i told you before every view function should take this request parameter should take this request parameter should take this request parameter like here we want to return an http like here we want to return an http like here we want to return an http response response response with the text new products with the text new products with the text new products that's it now to make pycharm happy we that's it now to make pycharm happy we that's it now to make pycharm happy we add add add another line break here so we have two another line break here so we have two another line break here so we have two line breaks after the index function and line breaks after the index function and line breaks after the index function and also two line breaks after the new also two line breaks after the new also two line breaks after the new function these are the best practices function these are the best practices function these are the best practices defined in pep 8 to format our code defined in pep 8 to format our code defined in pep 8 to format our code so we're done with this view function so we're done with this view function so we're done with this view function now we need to map it to a url endpoint now we need to map it to a url endpoint now we need to map it to a url endpoint so we go back to the products app and so we go back to the products app and so we go back to the products app and open up the urls module open up the urls module open up the urls module here we need to add another url pattern here we need to add another url pattern here we need to add another url pattern so we call the path function so we call the path function so we call the path function the first argument should be new you the first argument should be new you the first argument should be new you want to map this url endpoint to want to map this url endpoint to want to map this url endpoint to views dot new function that's all you views dot new function that's all you views dot new function that's all you have to do now back to our browser let have to do now back to our browser let have to do now back to our browser let me navigate to products new we get this me navigate to products new we get this me navigate to products new we get this message in the browser beautiful in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to create a model in a django how to create a model in a django how to create a model in a django project a model is a representation of a project a model is a representation of a project a model is a representation of a real world concept for example in an real world concept for example in an real world concept for example in an online shop we could have models like online shop we could have models like online shop we could have models like order customer shopping cart product order customer shopping cart product order customer shopping cart product review and so on so let's go ahead and review and so on so let's go ahead and review and so on so let's go ahead and create our first model create our first model create our first model here in the products app here in the products app here in the products app open up the models module open up the models module open up the models module in this module we're going to create a in this module we're going to create a in this module we're going to create a new class called product so let's delete new class called product so let's delete new class called product so let's delete this comment we don't really need it this comment we don't really need it this comment we don't really need it class class class product product product now we need to inherit this class from now we need to inherit this class from now we need to inherit this class from the model class in django so in the model class in django so in the model class in django so in parenthesis we type out models dot model parenthesis we type out models dot model parenthesis we type out models dot model let's see what's going on here so on let's see what's going on here so on let's see what's going on here so on line one from django.db package we are line one from django.db package we are line one from django.db package we are importing importing importing the models module the models module the models module in this module we have a class called in this module we have a class called in this module we have a class called model and this class defines all the model and this class defines all the model and this class defines all the common characteristics and behavior for common characteristics and behavior for common characteristics and behavior for models in a django application for models in a django application for models in a django application for example we want to be able to store example we want to be able to store example we want to be able to store these models in a database or read them these models in a database or read them these models in a database or read them from a database or delete them these are from a database or delete them these are from a database or delete them these are all the common operations that we need all the common operations that we need all the common operations that we need to perform on these model objects to perform on these model objects to perform on these model objects so by inheriting this product class from so by inheriting this product class from so by inheriting this product class from this model class our product class will this model class our product class will this model class our product class will have all these capabilities built into have all these capabilities built into have all these capabilities built into it we don't have to code it okay so it we don't have to code it okay so it we don't have to code it okay so colon now in this class we need to colon now in this class we need to colon now in this class we need to define a few attributes what are the define a few attributes what are the define a few attributes what are the attributes of a product that we need to attributes of a product that we need to attributes of a product that we need to know in an online shop we need to know know in an online shop we need to know know in an online shop we need to know their name their name their name price price price stock image and so on so let's define a stock image and so on so let's define a stock image and so on so let's define a new attribute new attribute new attribute we call it name and we set it to an we call it name and we set it to an we call it name and we set it to an instance instance instance of models the char field class of models the char field class of models the char field class so once again in this module we have a so once again in this module we have a so once again in this module we have a class called char field which is short class called char field which is short class called char field which is short for character field and this represents for character field and this represents for character field and this represents a field that can contain textual data a field that can contain textual data a field that can contain textual data now here as a best practice we can now here as a best practice we can now here as a best practice we can supply a maximum length to prevent a supply a maximum length to prevent a supply a maximum length to prevent a malicious user or hacker from malicious user or hacker from malicious user or hacker from accidentally storing a product with an accidentally storing a product with an accidentally storing a product with an enormously large name this can mess up enormously large name this can mess up enormously large name this can mess up with our application with our application with our application so let's pass a keyword argument max so let's pass a keyword argument max so let's pass a keyword argument max length and we set it to 255 characters length and we set it to 255 characters length and we set it to 255 characters now let's define the price attribute so now let's define the price attribute so now let's define the price attribute so we set price to models dot we set price to models dot we set price to models dot float field so this represents a field float field so this represents a field float field so this represents a field that can contain floating point numbers that can contain floating point numbers that can contain floating point numbers that's it that's it that's it now let's define the stock now let's define the stock now let's define the stock we set this to an instance of we set this to an instance of we set this to an instance of integer field integer field integer field and finally let's define and finally let's define and finally let's define image underline url image underline url image underline url to an instance of models dot to an instance of models dot to an instance of models dot one second char field one second char field one second char field so in this course we're gonna use google so in this course we're gonna use google so in this course we're gonna use google to find an image for our products for to find an image for our products for to find an image for our products for example we can find this image example we can find this image example we can find this image right click it right click it right click it and copy its link address which is the and copy its link address which is the and copy its link address which is the url url url now if you open up a new tab and paste now if you open up a new tab and paste now if you open up a new tab and paste that url you can see this is a very long that url you can see this is a very long that url you can see this is a very long string string string so we don't want to enforce a maximum so we don't want to enforce a maximum so we don't want to enforce a maximum length of 255 characters length of 255 characters length of 255 characters instead we want to use instead we want to use instead we want to use characters that is the standard maximum characters that is the standard maximum characters that is the standard maximum length for urls so our product class or length for urls so our product class or length for urls so our product class or product model has these four attributes product model has these four attributes product model has these four attributes now to make pycharm happy and remove now to make pycharm happy and remove now to make pycharm happy and remove this warning let's put the cursor at the this warning let's put the cursor at the this warning let's put the cursor at the end of this line press enter then end of this line press enter then end of this line press enter then backspace to remove the indentation backspace to remove the indentation backspace to remove the indentation beautiful we should also add beautiful we should also add beautiful we should also add two line breaks before this class so two line breaks before this class so two line breaks before this class so here's one press enter the second line here's one press enter the second line here's one press enter the second line break beautiful so our code is formatted break beautiful so our code is formatted break beautiful so our code is formatted according to pep8 standards next i'll according to pep8 standards next i'll according to pep8 standards next i'll show you how to use this model to create show you how to use this model to create show you how to use this model to create a database table for storing products in this django project we have created in this django project we have created in this django project we have created you can see we have this file you can see we have this file you can see we have this file db.sqlite3 this is an empty database db.sqlite3 this is an empty database db.sqlite3 this is an empty database file that django creates and we use this file that django creates and we use this file that django creates and we use this to store our data now sqlite is a kind to store our data now sqlite is a kind to store our data now sqlite is a kind of database and it's the same place for of database and it's the same place for of database and it's the same place for small applications but it's not suitable small applications but it's not suitable small applications but it's not suitable for large enterprise web applications so for large enterprise web applications so for large enterprise web applications so if you want to build a real enterprise if you want to build a real enterprise if you want to build a real enterprise web application with django you need to web application with django you need to web application with django you need to use a proper database engine like sql use a proper database engine like sql use a proper database engine like sql server mysql oracle postgres and so on server mysql oracle postgres and so on server mysql oracle postgres and so on the good news is that django supports the good news is that django supports the good news is that django supports all of these database engines but sqlite all of these database engines but sqlite all of these database engines but sqlite is the easiest to get started so we're is the easiest to get started so we're is the easiest to get started so we're going to work with this for now and in going to work with this for now and in going to work with this for now and in the future i will show you how to use a the future i will show you how to use a the future i will show you how to use a proper database engine proper database engine proper database engine now for the purpose of this tutorial i now for the purpose of this tutorial i now for the purpose of this tutorial i want you to open up your browser and want you to open up your browser and want you to open up your browser and search for db browser for sqlite search for db browser for sqlite search for db browser for sqlite so on this page sqlitebrowser.org so on this page sqlitebrowser.org so on this page sqlitebrowser.org you can find a very simple and free you can find a very simple and free you can find a very simple and free application for opening sqlite databases application for opening sqlite databases application for opening sqlite databases and as you can see here on the right and as you can see here on the right and as you can see here on the right side there are executables for windows side there are executables for windows side there are executables for windows mac and so on mac and so on mac and so on so when you open it you get something so when you open it you get something so when you open it you get something like this we can create a new database like this we can create a new database like this we can create a new database here on the top or open an existing one here on the top or open an existing one here on the top or open an existing one now here i'm going to drag and drop our now here i'm going to drag and drop our now here i'm going to drag and drop our database file right here database file right here database file right here you can see we don't have any tables in you can see we don't have any tables in you can see we don't have any tables in this database so to store data first we this database so to store data first we this database so to store data first we need to create a table for example to need to create a table for example to need to create a table for example to store the list of products we need to store the list of products we need to store the list of products we need to create a table called product and the create a table called product and the create a table called product and the fields or columns we have in this table fields or columns we have in this table fields or columns we have in this table should be exactly the same as the should be exactly the same as the should be exactly the same as the attributes we have attributes we have attributes we have in our product class in our product class in our product class so in this tutorial i'm going to show so in this tutorial i'm going to show so in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to use django to automatically you how to use django to automatically you how to use django to automatically create this table we don't have to do create this table we don't have to do create this table we don't have to do this by hand we can just tell django hey this by hand we can just tell django hey this by hand we can just tell django hey here's our model go ahead and here's our model go ahead and here's our model go ahead and automatically create a database table automatically create a database table automatically create a database table for storing our products for storing our products for storing our products that is very easy that is very easy that is very easy so here down the bottom let's open up a so here down the bottom let's open up a so here down the bottom let's open up a new terminal window and run python on new terminal window and run python on new terminal window and run python on windows or python 3 on mac windows or python 3 on mac windows or python 3 on mac manage.pi manage.pi manage.pi make migrations make migrations make migrations make sure to spell this properly so make make sure to spell this properly so make make sure to spell this properly so make migrations in one word migrations in one word migrations in one word now when you run this you get this now when you run this you get this now when you run this you get this message no changes detected because by message no changes detected because by message no changes detected because by default django doesn't know about our default django doesn't know about our default django doesn't know about our product model product model product model to solve this problem to solve this problem to solve this problem we need to go back to our project we need to go back to our project we need to go back to our project and open the pie shop package and open the pie shop package and open the pie shop package in this package we have this settings in this package we have this settings in this package we have this settings module for storing various configuration module for storing various configuration module for storing various configuration settings for our project settings for our project settings for our project so let's open this so let's open this so let's open this and scroll down and scroll down and scroll down on line 33 you can see a variable called on line 33 you can see a variable called on line 33 you can see a variable called installed apps set to a list of strings installed apps set to a list of strings installed apps set to a list of strings these are applications or apps that are these are applications or apps that are these are applications or apps that are automatically installed with every automatically installed with every automatically installed with every django project for example we have this django project for example we have this django project for example we have this admin app which gives us a beautiful admin app which gives us a beautiful admin app which gives us a beautiful administrative panel we're going to work administrative panel we're going to work administrative panel we're going to work with it soon you also have this auth app with it soon you also have this auth app with it soon you also have this auth app and we use this to authenticate users we and we use this to authenticate users we and we use this to authenticate users we can put them in different roles give can put them in different roles give can put them in different roles give them different permissions it's all them different permissions it's all them different permissions it's all about authentication and authorization about authentication and authorization about authentication and authorization we'll look at the other installed apps we'll look at the other installed apps we'll look at the other installed apps in a future tutorial so for now let's in a future tutorial so for now let's in a future tutorial so for now let's register our products app in this list register our products app in this list register our products app in this list how do we do that how do we do that how do we do that first we go to our project first we go to our project first we go to our project inside the products app earlier i told inside the products app earlier i told inside the products app earlier i told you about the apps module take a look you about the apps module take a look you about the apps module take a look here here here the name of this module is a little bit the name of this module is a little bit the name of this module is a little bit misleading because we're in the boundary misleading because we're in the boundary misleading because we're in the boundary of one app and we have a module called of one app and we have a module called of one app and we have a module called apps apps apps that aside all we have here is a class that aside all we have here is a class that aside all we have here is a class called products config where we store called products config where we store called products config where we store configuration settings for this configuration settings for this configuration settings for this particular app particular app particular app okay okay okay now we need to go back to our settings now we need to go back to our settings now we need to go back to our settings module and add the complete path to this module and add the complete path to this module and add the complete path to this class including its package and module class including its package and module class including its package and module so this class is defined in the apps so this class is defined in the apps so this class is defined in the apps module and this module is inside of the module and this module is inside of the module and this module is inside of the products package products package products package so back to the settings file so back to the settings file so back to the settings file in the list of installed apps we need to in the list of installed apps we need to in the list of installed apps we need to type out a string like this type out a string like this type out a string like this products that's our package products that's our package products that's our package dot dot dot apps that's our module apps that's our module apps that's our module and then products and then products and then products config config config again make sure to spell this properly again make sure to spell this properly again make sure to spell this properly so so so p and c are capitalized because here we p and c are capitalized because here we p and c are capitalized because here we have a class but products and apps are have a class but products and apps are have a class but products and apps are all in lower case okay all in lower case okay all in lower case okay so now django knows about our product so now django knows about our product so now django knows about our product app so when we go back to the terminal app so when we go back to the terminal app so when we go back to the terminal and run the last command we'll get a and run the last command we'll get a and run the last command we'll get a different result different result different result so use the up arrow to bring up the last so use the up arrow to bring up the last so use the up arrow to bring up the last command and enter command and enter command and enter there you go there you go there you go now we get this message migrations for now we get this message migrations for now we get this message migrations for products so inside the products folder products so inside the products folder products so inside the products folder inside the migrations folder we have a inside the migrations folder we have a inside the migrations folder we have a new module with this sequence number new module with this sequence number new module with this sequence number called initial called initial called initial let's have a quick look at the code let's have a quick look at the code let's have a quick look at the code inside this module so back to our inside this module so back to our inside this module so back to our products app let's expand the migrations products app let's expand the migrations products app let's expand the migrations folder folder folder here's our initial migration let's have here's our initial migration let's have here's our initial migration let's have a quick look here a quick look here a quick look here so we have a class called migration and so we have a class called migration and so we have a class called migration and in this class in this class in this class we have this attribute called operations we have this attribute called operations we have this attribute called operations which is set to a list of operations so which is set to a list of operations so which is set to a list of operations so every migration can contain multiple every migration can contain multiple every migration can contain multiple operations look at the first operation operations look at the first operation operations look at the first operation we have here migrations that create we have here migrations that create we have here migrations that create model model model so with this operation we can create a so with this operation we can create a so with this operation we can create a new database table called product and in new database table called product and in new database table called product and in that table we're going to have these that table we're going to have these that table we're going to have these fields id name price stock and image url fields id name price stock and image url fields id name price stock and image url these are the attributes that we created these are the attributes that we created these are the attributes that we created in our product class but we didn't have in our product class but we didn't have in our product class but we didn't have this id attribute django automatically this id attribute django automatically this id attribute django automatically generates this because every database generates this because every database generates this because every database table must have an id field and we use table must have an id field and we use table must have an id field and we use this to uniquely identify records in our this to uniquely identify records in our this to uniquely identify records in our database now let's go back to the database now let's go back to the database now let's go back to the terminal terminal terminal so we have a new migration but our so we have a new migration but our so we have a new migration but our database is still in its previous state database is still in its previous state database is still in its previous state we don't have a new table here yet we don't have a new table here yet we don't have a new table here yet so we need to run this new migration to so we need to run this new migration to so we need to run this new migration to generate our product table and that is generate our product table and that is generate our product table and that is very easy very easy very easy so one more time python so one more time python so one more time python manage the pi manage the pi manage the pi migrate migrate migrate when we run this command django will when we run this command django will when we run this command django will look at our project it will look at look at our project it will look at look at our project it will look at every app and it will run the pending every app and it will run the pending every app and it will run the pending migrations for that app against our migrations for that app against our migrations for that app against our database so take a look when we run this database so take a look when we run this database so take a look when we run this we get several messages we get several messages we get several messages so if you scroll up you can see applying so if you scroll up you can see applying so if you scroll up you can see applying content content content types.001 initial so in the content types.001 initial so in the content types.001 initial so in the content types app which is one of the apps types app which is one of the apps types app which is one of the apps installed by default we have this installed by default we have this installed by default we have this migration so django ran this migration migration so django ran this migration migration so django ran this migration and this created a database table for and this created a database table for and this created a database table for this app similarly in the auth app which this app similarly in the auth app which this app similarly in the auth app which is used for authenticating users we have is used for authenticating users we have is used for authenticating users we have this initial migration we also have a this initial migration we also have a this initial migration we also have a bunch of migrations for the admin app so bunch of migrations for the admin app so bunch of migrations for the admin app so django run all of these migrations and django run all of these migrations and django run all of these migrations and down the bottom you can see down the bottom you can see down the bottom you can see applying products initial migration applying products initial migration applying products initial migration so every app can contain multiple so every app can contain multiple so every app can contain multiple migrations and each migration will make migrations and each migration will make migrations and each migration will make a slight change to the database to add a a slight change to the database to add a a slight change to the database to add a new table or modify an existing one new table or modify an existing one new table or modify an existing one so back to db browser for sqlite let's so back to db browser for sqlite let's so back to db browser for sqlite let's drag and drop our database file one more drag and drop our database file one more drag and drop our database file one more time here to reload it there you go now time here to reload it there you go now time here to reload it there you go now we have 12 tables in this database each we have 12 tables in this database each we have 12 tables in this database each table is prefixed with the app it table is prefixed with the app it table is prefixed with the app it belongs to for example you can see we belongs to for example you can see we belongs to for example you can see we have a table for storing our users we have a table for storing our users we have a table for storing our users we have another table for storing the have another table for storing the have another table for storing the groups a user belongs to we have another groups a user belongs to we have another groups a user belongs to we have another table for storing permissions and so on table for storing permissions and so on table for storing permissions and so on now here down the bottom you can see now here down the bottom you can see now here down the bottom you can see is table products underlined product so is table products underlined product so is table products underlined product so this product table is prefixed with the this product table is prefixed with the this product table is prefixed with the name of our app which is products name of our app which is products name of our app which is products now if you expand this you can see now if you expand this you can see now if you expand this you can see these fields in this table id name price these fields in this table id name price these fields in this table id name price stock and image url so this is the stock and image url so this is the stock and image url so this is the beauty of django we didn't have to come beauty of django we didn't have to come beauty of django we didn't have to come here and manually create these tables by here and manually create these tables by here and manually create these tables by hand that's very time consuming we hand that's very time consuming we hand that's very time consuming we simply created a model with these simply created a model with these simply created a model with these attributes and then we ran two commands attributes and then we ran two commands attributes and then we ran two commands in the terminal one for creating a new in the terminal one for creating a new in the terminal one for creating a new migration based on the changes we have migration based on the changes we have migration based on the changes we have made in our code and the other to run made in our code and the other to run made in our code and the other to run the pending migrations so now all the the pending migrations so now all the the pending migrations so now all the migrations in this project are run migrations in this project are run migrations in this project are run against our database which means if we against our database which means if we against our database which means if we go back to the terminal and run python go back to the terminal and run python go back to the terminal and run python manage.pi migrate manage.pi migrate manage.pi migrate we get this new message no migrations to we get this new message no migrations to we get this new message no migrations to apply apply apply so here's the workflow next time we so here's the workflow next time we so here's the workflow next time we create a new model or modify an existing create a new model or modify an existing create a new model or modify an existing one we should come back here in the one we should come back here in the one we should come back here in the terminal create a new migration and then terminal create a new migration and then terminal create a new migration and then run it alright here's your exercise we want to alright here's your exercise we want to alright here's your exercise we want to have the concept of offering discounts have the concept of offering discounts have the concept of offering discounts in our imaginary online shop in our imaginary online shop in our imaginary online shop so i want you to create a new model so i want you to create a new model so i want you to create a new model class called offer class called offer class called offer and in this class we should have three and in this class we should have three and in this class we should have three attributes attributes attributes one is code which is a textual field for one is code which is a textual field for one is code which is a textual field for example our offers code could be vca2142 example our offers code could be vca2142 example our offers code could be vca2142 it's just a coupon code it's just a coupon code it's just a coupon code here we should also have an attribute here we should also have an attribute here we should also have an attribute called description called description called description again this is going to be a textual again this is going to be a textual again this is going to be a textual field for example we can say 20 percent field for example we can say 20 percent field for example we can say 20 percent of all products and then we can display of all products and then we can display of all products and then we can display this text somewhere on the home page in this text somewhere on the home page in this text somewhere on the home page in the future the future the future and finally we need another attribute and finally we need another attribute and finally we need another attribute called discount which is going to be a called discount which is going to be a called discount which is going to be a floating point number like 0.2 for 20 floating point number like 0.2 for 20 floating point number like 0.2 for 20 discount so go ahead create this model discount so go ahead create this model discount so go ahead create this model class next create a migration and run it class next create a migration and run it class next create a migration and run it to bring our database up to date this is to bring our database up to date this is to bring our database up to date this is an awesome exercise for you to get your an awesome exercise for you to get your an awesome exercise for you to get your hands dirty in django so spend three to hands dirty in django so spend three to hands dirty in django so spend three to five minutes on this exercise when five minutes on this exercise when five minutes on this exercise when you're done come back see my solution so here in the models module right after so here in the models module right after so here in the models module right after our product class i'm going to define a our product class i'm going to define a our product class i'm going to define a new class new class new class class offer class offer class offer this class should also derive from the this class should also derive from the this class should also derive from the model class in django model class in django model class in django here we add the attributes so here we add the attributes so here we add the attributes so the first one is code which is going to the first one is code which is going to the first one is code which is going to be an instance of models dot char field be an instance of models dot char field be an instance of models dot char field and we set the max length to let's say and we set the max length to let's say and we set the max length to let's say 10 characters 10 characters 10 characters next we add the description next we add the description next we add the description once again we're going to have a chart once again we're going to have a chart once again we're going to have a chart field with max length of 255 characters field with max length of 255 characters field with max length of 255 characters is sufficient and finally we need is sufficient and finally we need is sufficient and finally we need discount discount discount and we're going to set this to an and we're going to set this to an and we're going to set this to an instance of models that float filled so here's our offer class now we need to so here's our offer class now we need to so here's our offer class now we need to create a migration so over here i'm create a migration so over here i'm create a migration so over here i'm going to open up a terminal window going to open up a terminal window going to open up a terminal window this is the main terminal window where this is the main terminal window where this is the main terminal window where our web server is running so i'm going our web server is running so i'm going our web server is running so i'm going to create a new terminal window and run to create a new terminal window and run to create a new terminal window and run python python python manage dot pi manage dot pi manage dot pi make make make migrations django detected a change in migrations django detected a change in migrations django detected a change in our models so it created this new our models so it created this new our models so it created this new migration migration number two called migration migration number two called migration migration number two called offer and this migration will create the offer and this migration will create the offer and this migration will create the offer table in our database so let's go offer table in our database so let's go offer table in our database so let's go ahead and run it ahead and run it ahead and run it python3 python3 python3 manage.pi migrate manage.pi migrate manage.pi migrate beautiful beautiful beautiful now let's drag and drop our database now let's drag and drop our database now let's drag and drop our database here one more time here one more time here one more time our database is refreshed as you can see our database is refreshed as you can see our database is refreshed as you can see in the products app we have this new in the products app we have this new in the products app we have this new table offer with these four columns table offer with these four columns table offer with these four columns id code description and discount in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to in this tutorial i'm going to talk to you guys about the administrative panel you guys about the administrative panel you guys about the administrative panel of django applications so here in the of django applications so here in the of django applications so here in the browser if we head over to slash admin browser if we head over to slash admin browser if we head over to slash admin we get this beautiful login screen to we get this beautiful login screen to we get this beautiful login screen to log into our administrative panel so log into our administrative panel so log into our administrative panel so every django application by default every django application by default every django application by default comes with an administrative panel we comes with an administrative panel we comes with an administrative panel we don't have to create this from scratch don't have to create this from scratch don't have to create this from scratch we don't have to code this it gets we don't have to code this it gets we don't have to code this it gets auto-generated and this is one of the auto-generated and this is one of the auto-generated and this is one of the fantastic features of django that fantastic features of django that fantastic features of django that increases your productivity so let me increases your productivity so let me increases your productivity so let me show you how to work with this show you how to work with this show you how to work with this administrative panel administrative panel administrative panel here in pycharm we need to create the here in pycharm we need to create the here in pycharm we need to create the first user of this application we call first user of this application we call first user of this application we call that super user that super user that super user so here in the terminal window let's run so here in the terminal window let's run so here in the terminal window let's run python python python manage dot pi manage dot pi manage dot pi create create create super super super user all in one word user all in one word user all in one word so let's go ahead with that it asks for so let's go ahead with that it asks for so let's go ahead with that it asks for username let's type admin username let's type admin username let's type admin next we need to enter an email address next we need to enter an email address next we need to enter an email address i'm going to enter my email address next i'm going to enter my email address next i'm going to enter my email address next we need to enter a password i'm going to we need to enter a password i'm going to we need to enter a password i'm going to type one two three four type one two three four type one two three four and repeat it one more time and repeat it one more time and repeat it one more time note that it complains because this note that it complains because this note that it complains because this password is too short it's too common password is too short it's too common password is too short it's too common and it's entirely numeric and it's entirely numeric and it's entirely numeric so at the end it asks if you want to so at the end it asks if you want to so at the end it asks if you want to bypass password validation for bypass password validation for bypass password validation for simplicity let's go with that but of simplicity let's go with that but of simplicity let's go with that but of course in a real scenario you'll want to course in a real scenario you'll want to course in a real scenario you'll want to create an admin user with such a simple create an admin user with such a simple create an admin user with such a simple password password password all right we successfully created the all right we successfully created the all right we successfully created the super user super user super user now back in the browser let's log in now back in the browser let's log in now back in the browser let's log in with admin and one two three four with admin and one two three four with admin and one two three four there you go there you go there you go so this is our administrative panel as so this is our administrative panel as so this is our administrative panel as you can see we can manage the users and you can see we can manage the users and you can see we can manage the users and groups we can add new users or modify or groups we can add new users or modify or groups we can add new users or modify or delete existing ones let's have a quick delete existing ones let's have a quick delete existing ones let's have a quick look here so here we have this search look here so here we have this search look here so here we have this search bar on the top we can quickly search for bar on the top we can quickly search for bar on the top we can quickly search for users below that we have this table of users below that we have this table of users below that we have this table of users with this columns username email users with this columns username email users with this columns username email first name last name and status we can first name last name and status we can first name last name and status we can sort this table by any of these columns sort this table by any of these columns sort this table by any of these columns we also have these filters on the right we also have these filters on the right we also have these filters on the right side side side so we get all these beautiful features so we get all these beautiful features so we get all these beautiful features for free with every django application for free with every django application for free with every django application we don't have to code this we don't have to code this we don't have to code this earlier in this course we talked about earlier in this course we talked about earlier in this course we talked about this settings module let's have a quick this settings module let's have a quick this settings module let's have a quick look here look here look here in this module we have in this module we have in this module we have a setting or variable called installed a setting or variable called installed a setting or variable called installed apps and one of the apps that is apps and one of the apps that is apps and one of the apps that is installed by default is the admin app installed by default is the admin app installed by default is the admin app so this app is the piece that is so this app is the piece that is so this app is the piece that is responsible for generating these views responsible for generating these views responsible for generating these views now the beautiful thing about the admin now the beautiful thing about the admin now the beautiful thing about the admin app is that it is easily extensible so app is that it is easily extensible so app is that it is easily extensible so back to the home page of our back to the home page of our back to the home page of our administrative panel so far we can only administrative panel so far we can only administrative panel so far we can only manage the users and groups but using manage the users and groups but using manage the users and groups but using one line of code we can also manage our one line of code we can also manage our one line of code we can also manage our products let me show you products let me show you products let me show you let's expand our products app let's expand our products app let's expand our products app inside of this app we have this module inside of this app we have this module inside of this app we have this module admin and in this module we register the admin and in this module we register the admin and in this module we register the models that we need to manage in the models that we need to manage in the models that we need to manage in the admin section admin section admin section so let's open this module so let's open this module so let's open this module now on the top now on the top now on the top first we need to import our product first we need to import our product first we need to import our product model so we can type out some code like model so we can type out some code like model so we can type out some code like this from period models that means the this from period models that means the this from period models that means the models module in the current folder models module in the current folder models module in the current folder so from this module we want to import so from this module we want to import so from this module we want to import the product class or the product model the product class or the product model the product class or the product model right right right now you can see this comment here now you can see this comment here now you can see this comment here register your models here let's delete register your models here let's delete register your models here let's delete this comment we don't need it anymore this comment we don't need it anymore this comment we don't need it anymore instead we're going to write code like instead we're going to write code like instead we're going to write code like this so admin this so admin this so admin dot site dot register dot site dot register dot site dot register and we pass this product class as an and we pass this product class as an and we pass this product class as an argument what is going on here argument what is going on here argument what is going on here we're using this admin object that is we're using this admin object that is we're using this admin object that is imported imported imported on line one this object has an attribute on line one this object has an attribute on line one this object has an attribute called site which is an object itself called site which is an object itself called site which is an object itself this object has a method called register this object has a method called register this object has a method called register we're calling this method and passing we're calling this method and passing we're calling this method and passing our product class as an argument with our product class as an argument with our product class as an argument with this we're telling django that we want this we're telling django that we want this we're telling django that we want to manage our products in the admin area to manage our products in the admin area to manage our products in the admin area so now with only one line of code or so now with only one line of code or so now with only one line of code or more accurately two lines if we go back more accurately two lines if we go back more accurately two lines if we go back to our administrative panel and refresh to our administrative panel and refresh to our administrative panel and refresh this page this page this page we see this new table products that we see this new table products that we see this new table products that represents our products app and in this represents our products app and in this represents our products app and in this app currently we only have one model app currently we only have one model app currently we only have one model called product so here we can manage all called product so here we can manage all called product so here we can manage all our products currently we don't have any our products currently we don't have any our products currently we don't have any products in our database so let's go products in our database so let's go products in our database so let's go ahead and add a new product look we get ahead and add a new product look we get ahead and add a new product look we get this beautiful form for free we didn't this beautiful form for free we didn't this beautiful form for free we didn't write any code to create this form and write any code to create this form and write any code to create this form and handle the click event of these buttons handle the click event of these buttons handle the click event of these buttons to insert a product into our database to insert a product into our database to insert a product into our database all this is automatically generated by all this is automatically generated by all this is automatically generated by django django django so let's go ahead and add a new product so let's go ahead and add a new product so let's go ahead and add a new product call that orange let's say 1.99 each call that orange let's say 1.99 each call that orange let's say 1.99 each and and and set the stock to 50. set the stock to 50. set the stock to 50. now we need an image url so open up a now we need an image url so open up a now we need an image url so open up a new tab here new tab here new tab here and in google search for orange and in google search for orange and in google search for orange then then then go to images go to images go to images click on tools click on tools click on tools from the user rate menu select for from the user rate menu select for from the user rate menu select for labeled for reuse this way we don't have labeled for reuse this way we don't have labeled for reuse this way we don't have problem with copyright issues so these problem with copyright issues so these problem with copyright issues so these are the three images that we can use in are the three images that we can use in are the three images that we can use in our application our application our application let's pick this one let's pick this one let's pick this one click on it again click on it again click on it again now on this page right click the image now on this page right click the image now on this page right click the image copy a link address copy a link address copy a link address and then back to our product form and then back to our product form and then back to our product form paste it here paste it here paste it here and then save and then save and then save so we successfully added a product and so we successfully added a product and so we successfully added a product and that product is listed here in the that product is listed here in the that product is listed here in the product table but what we see here is a product table but what we see here is a product table but what we see here is a little bit confusing it says product little bit confusing it says product little bit confusing it says product object one it's not clear what product object one it's not clear what product object one it's not clear what product this is is it an orange is it a this is is it an orange is it a this is is it an orange is it a strawberry what price is it so in the strawberry what price is it so in the strawberry what price is it so in the next tutorial i will show you how to next tutorial i will show you how to next tutorial i will show you how to customize this table and add columns customize this table and add columns customize this table and add columns specific to products in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you guys how to customize this products guys how to customize this products guys how to customize this products table in the admin area that is very table in the admin area that is very table in the admin area that is very easy so back to pycharm easy so back to pycharm easy so back to pycharm here in the admin module where we here in the admin module where we here in the admin module where we register the product class for register the product class for register the product class for administration we need to create a new administration we need to create a new administration we need to create a new class called product admin so class called product admin so class called product admin so we create a class we create a class we create a class called product admin so this is the called product admin so this is the called product admin so this is the convention we follow in django we start convention we follow in django we start convention we follow in django we start with the name of our model that is with the name of our model that is with the name of our model that is product and then we add the suffix admin product and then we add the suffix admin product and then we add the suffix admin now we should inherit this class from now we should inherit this class from now we should inherit this class from admin admin admin dot model admin what is going on here dot model admin what is going on here dot model admin what is going on here well this admin is a module that we have well this admin is a module that we have well this admin is a module that we have imported on line one imported on line one imported on line one in this module we have a class called in this module we have a class called in this module we have a class called model admin which provides all the model admin which provides all the model admin which provides all the common functionality for managing models common functionality for managing models common functionality for managing models in the admin area so with deriving this in the admin area so with deriving this in the admin area so with deriving this class from the model admin this class class from the model admin this class class from the model admin this class inherits all this common functionality inherits all this common functionality inherits all this common functionality now now now in the body of this class we can in the body of this class we can in the body of this class we can overwrite or change some of this overwrite or change some of this overwrite or change some of this functionality or attributes for example functionality or attributes for example functionality or attributes for example in this class we have an attribute in this class we have an attribute in this class we have an attribute called list called list called list underline display and this attribute underline display and this attribute underline display and this attribute specifies the columns that should be specifies the columns that should be specifies the columns that should be visible in this table visible in this table visible in this table so we set this to a tuple so we set this to a tuple so we set this to a tuple and in this tuple we add one or more and in this tuple we add one or more and in this tuple we add one or more attributes of our product class attributes of our product class attributes of our product class so let's quickly open up our product so let's quickly open up our product so let's quickly open up our product class class class it's here in the models module it's here in the models module it's here in the models module okay there you go so our product class okay there you go so our product class okay there you go so our product class has these attributes name price stock has these attributes name price stock has these attributes name price stock and image url now image url as you saw and image url now image url as you saw and image url now image url as you saw is a long string so we don't want to is a long string so we don't want to is a long string so we don't want to display that in our table so in this display that in our table so in this display that in our table so in this tutorial let's add these three tutorial let's add these three tutorial let's add these three attributes to our products table attributes to our products table attributes to our products table back to the admin module back to the admin module back to the admin module in this tuple we add three strings name in this tuple we add three strings name in this tuple we add three strings name price price price and stock and stock and stock now we have this little warning here now we have this little warning here now we have this little warning here because we haven't added two line breaks because we haven't added two line breaks because we haven't added two line breaks before and before and before and after this class after this class after this class that is better that is better that is better finally when registering our product finally when registering our product finally when registering our product class for administration class for administration class for administration as the second argument we need to pass as the second argument we need to pass as the second argument we need to pass this new class product admin this new class product admin this new class product admin so django will use the information in so django will use the information in so django will use the information in this class to decide how to present the this class to decide how to present the this class to decide how to present the list of products list of products list of products so back in the browser let's refresh so back in the browser let's refresh so back in the browser let's refresh this page there you go here's our this page there you go here's our this page there you go here's our products table now we have three columns products table now we have three columns products table now we have three columns name price and stock you can see we have name price and stock you can see we have name price and stock you can see we have this orange the price is set to 1.99 and this orange the price is set to 1.99 and this orange the price is set to 1.99 and currently we have 50 items in the stock currently we have 50 items in the stock currently we have 50 items in the stock beautiful let's go ahead and add a new beautiful let's go ahead and add a new beautiful let's go ahead and add a new product here product here product here let's say strawberry let's say strawberry let's say strawberry and the price 2.99 and the price 2.99 and the price 2.99 30 for the stock and finally we need an 30 for the stock and finally we need an 30 for the stock and finally we need an image url i'm going to paste this image url i'm going to paste this image url i'm going to paste this address that i just copied before address that i just copied before address that i just copied before recording this video okay let's go ahead recording this video okay let's go ahead recording this video okay let's go ahead save the changes save the changes save the changes the product is added beautiful and now the product is added beautiful and now the product is added beautiful and now we have two products in our table now we have two products in our table now we have two products in our table now here's what i want you to do i want you here's what i want you to do i want you here's what i want you to do i want you to pause the video and add a few more to pause the video and add a few more to pause the video and add a few more products to our database somewhere products to our database somewhere products to our database somewhere around 5 to 10. in the next tutorial i'm around 5 to 10. in the next tutorial i'm around 5 to 10. in the next tutorial i'm going to show you how to display these going to show you how to display these going to show you how to display these products to the public users of our products to the public users of our products to the public users of our website because this admin panel is only website because this admin panel is only website because this admin panel is only visible to admins so anonymous users or visible to admins so anonymous users or visible to admins so anonymous users or other registered users are not going to other registered users are not going to other registered users are not going to have access to this panel instead have access to this panel instead have access to this panel instead they're going to go to they're going to go to they're going to go to slash slash slash products products products and currently we're displaying a hello and currently we're displaying a hello and currently we're displaying a hello world message we're going to change this world message we're going to change this world message we're going to change this page and display the list of our page and display the list of our page and display the list of our products in a beautiful grid so pause products in a beautiful grid so pause products in a beautiful grid so pause the video and add five to ten products the video and add five to ten products the video and add five to ten products then come back continue watching currently in the admin area we can only currently in the admin area we can only currently in the admin area we can only manage the products in the products app manage the products in the products app manage the products in the products app so there is no way to manage the offers so there is no way to manage the offers so there is no way to manage the offers so as an exercise add the ability to so as an exercise add the ability to so as an exercise add the ability to manage the offers here when we click the manage the offers here when we click the manage the offers here when we click the offers link we should see a table with offers link we should see a table with offers link we should see a table with two columns code and discount two columns code and discount two columns code and discount so go ahead and implement this and then so go ahead and implement this and then so go ahead and implement this and then create a new offer all right here's my solution all right here's my solution all right here's my solution in the admin module of the products app in the admin module of the products app in the admin module of the products app on line two first we need to import on line two first we need to import on line two first we need to import the offer class the offer class the offer class next next next we create a new class called offer admin we create a new class called offer admin we create a new class called offer admin we derive this from admin that model we derive this from admin that model we derive this from admin that model admin admin admin and here we set the list display and here we set the list display and here we set the list display attribute to a tuple with two items attribute to a tuple with two items attribute to a tuple with two items code code code and discount and discount and discount and finally we need to register our and finally we need to register our and finally we need to register our offer model for administration offer model for administration offer model for administration so admin.site.register offer and offer admin offer and offer admin offer and offer admin that's it that's it that's it now if we go back to the admin area now if we go back to the admin area now if we go back to the admin area and refresh the home page we see the and refresh the home page we see the and refresh the home page we see the offers link here beautiful currently we offers link here beautiful currently we offers link here beautiful currently we don't have any offers so let's go ahead don't have any offers so let's go ahead don't have any offers so let's go ahead and add a new offer and add a new offer and add a new offer i'm going to use the code like vca 1010 i'm going to use the code like vca 1010 i'm going to use the code like vca 1010 let's say 10 let's say 10 let's say 10 off all products off all products off all products and discount i'm going to set this to and discount i'm going to set this to and discount i'm going to set this to 0.1 0.1 0.1 now technically in a real application now technically in a real application now technically in a real application this code should be unique but that's a this code should be unique but that's a this code should be unique but that's a topic for a future tutorial so for now topic for a future tutorial so for now topic for a future tutorial so for now don't worry about it let's go ahead and don't worry about it let's go ahead and don't worry about it let's go ahead and save this offer save this offer save this offer okay our offer is saved successfully okay our offer is saved successfully okay our offer is saved successfully beautiful as you can see in this table beautiful as you can see in this table beautiful as you can see in this table we have two columns code and discount in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you guys how to replace this hello world guys how to replace this hello world guys how to replace this hello world message with the list of products in our message with the list of products in our message with the list of products in our database and that is super easy database and that is super easy database and that is super easy so here in pycharm in the products app so here in pycharm in the products app so here in pycharm in the products app let's open up the views module let's open up the views module let's open up the views module area i told you that in this module we area i told you that in this module we area i told you that in this module we define our view functions which are define our view functions which are define our view functions which are functions that get called when the functions that get called when the functions that get called when the browser sends an http request to the browser sends an http request to the browser sends an http request to the server server server for example when the user navigates to for example when the user navigates to for example when the user navigates to slash products page our browser sends an slash products page our browser sends an slash products page our browser sends an http request to our django application http request to our django application http request to our django application django takes that request and hands it django takes that request and hands it django takes that request and hands it off to this function the index function off to this function the index function off to this function the index function and here we're simply returning a hello and here we're simply returning a hello and here we're simply returning a hello world message we want to replace this world message we want to replace this world message we want to replace this with the list of products in our with the list of products in our with the list of products in our database database database so the first step is to get the products so the first step is to get the products so the first step is to get the products stored in the database and then we need stored in the database and then we need stored in the database and then we need to format them using some html template to format them using some html template to format them using some html template so let's go ahead and so let's go ahead and so let's go ahead and on the top import our product class from on the top import our product class from on the top import our product class from the models module so the models module so the models module so from from from period models period models period models import product so we're importing the import product so we're importing the import product so we're importing the product class in the models module in product class in the models module in product class in the models module in the current folder so period means the the current folder so period means the the current folder so period means the current folder current folder current folder now this product class has a bunch of now this product class has a bunch of now this product class has a bunch of useful methods for getting data from our useful methods for getting data from our useful methods for getting data from our database for example we can call database for example we can call database for example we can call product.objects.all product.objects.all product.objects.all and this returns all the products we and this returns all the products we and this returns all the products we have in our database we also have filter have in our database we also have filter have in our database we also have filter for filtering products let's say we want for filtering products let's say we want for filtering products let's say we want to get products that are more expensive to get products that are more expensive to get products that are more expensive than two dollars or products that are than two dollars or products that are than two dollars or products that are out of stock we can use the filter out of stock we can use the filter out of stock we can use the filter method we also have the get method for method we also have the get method for method we also have the get method for getting a single product and we also getting a single product and we also getting a single product and we also have the save method for inserting a new have the save method for inserting a new have the save method for inserting a new product or updating an existing one now product or updating an existing one now product or updating an existing one now in this tutorial we're going to use the in this tutorial we're going to use the in this tutorial we're going to use the all method to get all the products from all method to get all the products from all method to get all the products from our database our database our database then we store them here in this variable then we store them here in this variable then we store them here in this variable so we have done the first step next we so we have done the first step next we so we have done the first step next we need to create an html template for need to create an html template for need to create an html template for presenting this list of products to the presenting this list of products to the presenting this list of products to the user so back to the project panel user so back to the project panel user so back to the project panel inside the products app inside the products app inside the products app let's add a new folder a new directory let's add a new folder a new directory let's add a new folder a new directory and by convention we should call that and by convention we should call that and by convention we should call that templates make sure to spell it properly templates make sure to spell it properly templates make sure to spell it properly because this is a special directory that because this is a special directory that because this is a special directory that django looks at the load templates django looks at the load templates django looks at the load templates so let's go ahead with that now we want so let's go ahead with that now we want so let's go ahead with that now we want to create a template for the index to create a template for the index to create a template for the index function so inside of this folder let's function so inside of this folder let's function so inside of this folder let's add a new file add a new file add a new file and call that file index and call that file index and call that file index dot html dot html dot html now here we can write some html code if now here we can write some html code if now here we can write some html code if you're not familiar with html don't you're not familiar with html don't you're not familiar with html don't worry just follow along with me it's worry just follow along with me it's worry just follow along with me it's super easy to learn super easy to learn super easy to learn so first let's type h1 and then press so first let's type h1 and then press so first let's type h1 and then press tab tab tab this inserts an h1 tag into our html this inserts an h1 tag into our html this inserts an h1 tag into our html document and we use this to display a document and we use this to display a document and we use this to display a big bold heading so inside these tags big bold heading so inside these tags big bold heading so inside these tags let's type products let's type products let's type products now below this h1 let's type ul and now below this h1 let's type ul and now below this h1 let's type ul and press tab press tab press tab now this inserts a ul tag and we use now this inserts a ul tag and we use now this inserts a ul tag and we use this to display a list of items now we this to display a list of items now we this to display a list of items now we need to surround each item with an li need to surround each item with an li need to surround each item with an li tag so type out li press tab tag so type out li press tab tag so type out li press tab and in between the tags let's type item and in between the tags let's type item and in between the tags let's type item 1 then copy and paste this a couple 1 then copy and paste this a couple 1 then copy and paste this a couple times so item 2 and item 3. now instead times so item 2 and item 3. now instead times so item 2 and item 3. now instead of item 1 item 2 and item 3 we want to of item 1 item 2 and item 3 we want to of item 1 item 2 and item 3 we want to display the name of our products but display the name of our products but display the name of our products but before we get there let's simply return before we get there let's simply return before we get there let's simply return this html markup to the client instead this html markup to the client instead this html markup to the client instead of the hello world message of the hello world message of the hello world message so back to the views module so back to the views module so back to the views module here in the index function we need to here in the index function we need to here in the index function we need to change the return statement on line 8. change the return statement on line 8. change the return statement on line 8. so so so you want to call the render function you want to call the render function you want to call the render function this function is already imported on the this function is already imported on the this function is already imported on the top on line 2. we use this function to top on line 2. we use this function to top on line 2. we use this function to render a template render a template render a template so so so let's call this function as the first let's call this function as the first let's call this function as the first argument we need to pass argument we need to pass argument we need to pass this request object that we get as an this request object that we get as an this request object that we get as an argument to this function argument to this function argument to this function so let's pass the request here so let's pass the request here so let's pass the request here as the second argument we need to as the second argument we need to as the second argument we need to specify the name of our template so we specify the name of our template so we specify the name of our template so we pass a string what is the name of our pass a string what is the name of our pass a string what is the name of our template that is template that is template that is index.html right now before going any index.html right now before going any index.html right now before going any further let's go back to the browser further let's go back to the browser further let's go back to the browser and and and refresh this page refresh this page refresh this page so instead of hello world we see this so instead of hello world we see this so instead of hello world we see this product's heading this is the result of product's heading this is the result of product's heading this is the result of an h1 tag and with ul and li tags we see an h1 tag and with ul and li tags we see an h1 tag and with ul and li tags we see these bullet points over here beautiful these bullet points over here beautiful these bullet points over here beautiful now finally we need to replace item one now finally we need to replace item one now finally we need to replace item one item two and item three with the list of item two and item three with the list of item two and item three with the list of our products our products our products so back to our view function so back to our view function so back to our view function as the third argument to the render as the third argument to the render as the third argument to the render function we need to pass the list of function we need to pass the list of function we need to pass the list of products that we loaded from the products that we loaded from the products that we loaded from the database so here we need to pass a database so here we need to pass a database so here we need to pass a dictionary dictionary dictionary in this dictionary we're going to add in this dictionary we're going to add in this dictionary we're going to add one key value pair we're going to call one key value pair we're going to call one key value pair we're going to call the key products but we could call it the key products but we could call it the key products but we could call it anything it doesn't really matter anything it doesn't really matter anything it doesn't really matter the value for that key should be the the value for that key should be the the value for that key should be the products object that we define on line products object that we define on line products object that we define on line 7. 7. 7. so so so here in our dictionary let's add this here in our dictionary let's add this here in our dictionary let's add this key product key product key product colon and the value should be colon and the value should be colon and the value should be this product object this product object this product object so let me break up what we have on line so let me break up what we have on line so let me break up what we have on line eight eight eight over multiple lines so you can see it over multiple lines so you can see it over multiple lines so you can see it clearly clearly clearly recording the render function with three recording the render function with three recording the render function with three arguments the request object the name of arguments the request object the name of arguments the request object the name of our template and a dictionary that our template and a dictionary that our template and a dictionary that contains the data to be passed to this contains the data to be passed to this contains the data to be passed to this template template template and finally we're going to go to this and finally we're going to go to this and finally we're going to go to this template template template index.html index.html index.html and replace these items with our and replace these items with our and replace these items with our products that is very easy products that is very easy products that is very easy so just after the ul tag i want you to so just after the ul tag i want you to so just after the ul tag i want you to type out a curly brace followed by a type out a curly brace followed by a type out a curly brace followed by a percent a space a percent one more time percent a space a percent one more time percent a space a percent one more time and a closing brace and a closing brace and a closing brace this is what we call a template tag in this is what we call a template tag in this is what we call a template tag in django so in between these markers we django so in between these markers we django so in between these markers we can write dynamic code for example we can write dynamic code for example we can write dynamic code for example we can add loops to repeat some can add loops to repeat some can add loops to repeat some instructions or write if statements to instructions or write if statements to instructions or write if statements to conditionally render some content conditionally render some content conditionally render some content so here we want to write a for loop for so here we want to write a for loop for so here we want to write a for loop for product product product in in in products products products so earlier in our view function we so earlier in our view function we so earlier in our view function we passed these products here using a passed these products here using a passed these products here using a dictionary back to the view function dictionary back to the view function dictionary back to the view function look look look as the third argument to the render as the third argument to the render as the third argument to the render function we passed is dictionary this function we passed is dictionary this function we passed is dictionary this dictionary is called the context so it dictionary is called the context so it dictionary is called the context so it provides data to be used in our provides data to be used in our provides data to be used in our templates in this case we have a templates in this case we have a templates in this case we have a property called products and that is the property called products and that is the property called products and that is the reason we can access it here so we are reason we can access it here so we are reason we can access it here so we are looping over this product looping over this product looping over this product now for each product you want to render now for each product you want to render now for each product you want to render a list item so let's indent this item a list item so let's indent this item a list item so let's indent this item here here here and and and replace item 1 with the name of the replace item 1 with the name of the replace item 1 with the name of the product so here we want to dynamically product so here we want to dynamically product so here we want to dynamically render the name attribute of this render the name attribute of this render the name attribute of this product object product object product object to do that we use double curly braces so to do that we use double curly braces so to do that we use double curly braces so open two curly braces and close them and open two curly braces and close them and open two curly braces and close them and in between them type out product dot in between them type out product dot in between them type out product dot name so whenever we use double curly name so whenever we use double curly name so whenever we use double curly braces in a django template django will braces in a django template django will braces in a django template django will evaluate the expression that we put here evaluate the expression that we put here evaluate the expression that we put here and render it in html and render it in html and render it in html now the last step is to end this four now the last step is to end this four now the last step is to end this four block because django unlike python block because django unlike python block because django unlike python doesn't rely on indentation to determine doesn't rely on indentation to determine doesn't rely on indentation to determine the scope of a block the scope of a block the scope of a block so so so right after this for loop once again we right after this for loop once again we right after this for loop once again we add curly braces eight percent and type add curly braces eight percent and type add curly braces eight percent and type out and four out and four out and four and then we close it here and then we close it here and then we close it here now we no longer need these items here now we no longer need these items here now we no longer need these items here so let's delete them so let's delete them so let's delete them now back to the browser let's refresh now back to the browser let's refresh now back to the browser let's refresh our page our page our page so instead of item 1 to 3 we see the so instead of item 1 to 3 we see the so instead of item 1 to 3 we see the name of the products stored in our name of the products stored in our name of the products stored in our database database database now let's take this to the next level by now let's take this to the next level by now let's take this to the next level by displaying the price of each product displaying the price of each product displaying the price of each product right next to it right next to it right next to it so so so back to our template this is where we're back to our template this is where we're back to our template this is where we're rendering the name of the product rendering the name of the product rendering the name of the product after the curly braces let's add after the curly braces let's add after the curly braces let's add parenthesis now inside of the parenthesis now inside of the parenthesis now inside of the parenthesis we want to dynamically parenthesis we want to dynamically parenthesis we want to dynamically render the price of each product so once render the price of each product so once render the price of each product so once again we use again we use again we use the double curly brace syntax to render the double curly brace syntax to render the double curly brace syntax to render some value dynamically that is the value some value dynamically that is the value some value dynamically that is the value of product dot price of product dot price of product dot price like this like this like this now back here let's refresh the page now back here let's refresh the page now back here let's refresh the page now we can see the price of each product now we can see the price of each product now we can see the price of each product right here beautiful we could also right here beautiful we could also right here beautiful we could also prefix that with a dollar sign so before prefix that with a dollar sign so before prefix that with a dollar sign so before the curly braces we add a dollar sign the curly braces we add a dollar sign the curly braces we add a dollar sign and then when we refresh the page we see and then when we refresh the page we see and then when we refresh the page we see the actual dollar value the actual dollar value the actual dollar value so this is what i want you to take away so this is what i want you to take away so this is what i want you to take away in this tutorial in django templates we in this tutorial in django templates we in this tutorial in django templates we have two special syntaxes one is a curly have two special syntaxes one is a curly have two special syntaxes one is a curly brace and a percent this is called a brace and a percent this is called a brace and a percent this is called a template tag and we use this to template tag and we use this to template tag and we use this to dynamically execute logic dynamically execute logic dynamically execute logic so in between these template tags we can so in between these template tags we can so in between these template tags we can write for loops to repeat some code or write for loops to repeat some code or write for loops to repeat some code or we can use if statements to dynamically we can use if statements to dynamically we can use if statements to dynamically render content render content render content the other syntax we have is the double the other syntax we have is the double the other syntax we have is the double curly brace syntax and we use this to curly brace syntax and we use this to curly brace syntax and we use this to dynamically render values in our html dynamically render values in our html dynamically render values in our html markup so whatever we put in between markup so whatever we put in between markup so whatever we put in between them will get evaluated and written to them will get evaluated and written to them will get evaluated and written to the html markup the html markup the html markup now this page is pretty boring so far in now this page is pretty boring so far in now this page is pretty boring so far in the next tutorial i will show you how to the next tutorial i will show you how to the next tutorial i will show you how to convert these bullet points into convert these bullet points into convert these bullet points into beautiful cards over the next few tutorials we're going over the next few tutorials we're going over the next few tutorials we're going to replace this boring list of bullet to replace this boring list of bullet to replace this boring list of bullet points with a beautiful modern card like points with a beautiful modern card like points with a beautiful modern card like this so on the top we're going to this so on the top we're going to this so on the top we're going to display the image for each product below display the image for each product below display the image for each product below that we're going to display the title or that we're going to display the title or that we're going to display the title or the name of the product as well as the the name of the product as well as the the name of the product as well as the price and potentially a button to add price and potentially a button to add price and potentially a button to add that product to a shopping cart now to that product to a shopping cart now to that product to a shopping cart now to present something like this we're going present something like this we're going present something like this we're going to use a framework called bootstrap it's to use a framework called bootstrap it's to use a framework called bootstrap it's a very popular framework for building a very popular framework for building a very popular framework for building modern and responsive applications so modern and responsive applications so modern and responsive applications so head over to getbootstrap.com head over to getbootstrap.com head over to getbootstrap.com on the home page on the home page on the home page you should see something like this and you should see something like this and you should see something like this and then go to the documentation then go to the documentation then go to the documentation on this page you can see how you can add on this page you can see how you can add on this page you can see how you can add this bootstrap framework to your web this bootstrap framework to your web this bootstrap framework to your web applications so if you scroll down applications so if you scroll down applications so if you scroll down here you should see a starter template here you should see a starter template here you should see a starter template so here we have some basic html markup so here we have some basic html markup so here we have some basic html markup we want to bring all this html markup we want to bring all this html markup we want to bring all this html markup and store it in a template called and store it in a template called and store it in a template called base.html so over here you should see base.html so over here you should see base.html so over here you should see this copy button click that to copy this this copy button click that to copy this this copy button click that to copy this then back to pycharm then back to pycharm then back to pycharm in the project panel in the project panel in the project panel inside of the templates folder let's add inside of the templates folder let's add inside of the templates folder let's add a new html file so a new file we call a new html file so a new file we call a new html file so a new file we call this base.html now now now with command and v on mac or ctrl and v with command and v on mac or ctrl and v with command and v on mac or ctrl and v on windows paste all this markup that we on windows paste all this markup that we on windows paste all this markup that we copied from bootstrap website copied from bootstrap website copied from bootstrap website now now now here on line 13 here on line 13 here on line 13 we have the body tag and this is the we have the body tag and this is the we have the body tag and this is the container for what the user sees in a container for what the user sees in a container for what the user sees in a given web page given web page given web page now in this example we have an h1 tag now in this example we have an h1 tag now in this example we have an h1 tag for displaying a hello world title we for displaying a hello world title we for displaying a hello world title we want to replace this with something want to replace this with something want to replace this with something dynamic so for each page in our dynamic so for each page in our dynamic so for each page in our application we want to render something application we want to render something application we want to render something different for example when the user goes different for example when the user goes different for example when the user goes to the products page over here instead to the products page over here instead to the products page over here instead of this h1 tag we want to render what we of this h1 tag we want to render what we of this h1 tag we want to render what we defined in index.html here defined in index.html here defined in index.html here okay okay okay so back to base.html let's delete this so back to base.html let's delete this so back to base.html let's delete this h1 tag once again we're going to use a h1 tag once again we're going to use a h1 tag once again we're going to use a template tag so curly brace percent template tag so curly brace percent template tag so curly brace percent percent curly brace percent curly brace percent curly brace now the template tag we're going to use now the template tag we're going to use now the template tag we're going to use is called block and with this we can is called block and with this we can is called block and with this we can define a block or a hole in this define a block or a hole in this define a block or a hole in this document so we're going to create a document so we're going to create a document so we're going to create a block called content we could call it block called content we could call it block called content we could call it anything but here we're defining the anything but here we're defining the anything but here we're defining the content area of our website content area of our website content area of our website so that's why we call this block content so that's why we call this block content so that's why we call this block content now after this once again we need to add now after this once again we need to add now after this once again we need to add another template tag another template tag another template tag and this is called end and this is called end and this is called end block now we should go to index.html block now we should go to index.html block now we should go to index.html on the top we should tell django that we on the top we should tell django that we on the top we should tell django that we want to extend this base template which want to extend this base template which want to extend this base template which means we're going to use all the markup means we're going to use all the markup means we're going to use all the markup defined here defined here defined here and this gives our applications a modern and this gives our applications a modern and this gives our applications a modern look and feel look and feel look and feel so back to index.html once again we're so back to index.html once again we're so back to index.html once again we're going to use another template tag going to use another template tag going to use another template tag this one is called extends so extend this one is called extends so extend this one is called extends so extend what are we extending what are we extending what are we extending the template defined in base.html so the template defined in base.html so the template defined in base.html so here we add a string base here we add a string base here we add a string base dot html dot html dot html now we want to fill the block or the now we want to fill the block or the now we want to fill the block or the hole that we defined in base.html hole that we defined in base.html hole that we defined in base.html with with with these view lines these view lines these view lines so once again we add a template tag so once again we add a template tag so once again we add a template tag block what is the block that we're block what is the block that we're block what is the block that we're filling that is the content block right filling that is the content block right filling that is the content block right and we close it here and we close it here and we close it here so now all this markup is going to go so now all this markup is going to go so now all this markup is going to go in the content block in the content block in the content block now finally we need to close this block now finally we need to close this block now finally we need to close this block so after the last line so after the last line so after the last line let's add another template tag let's add another template tag let's add another template tag and block and block and block now to make this code cleaner i would now to make this code cleaner i would now to make this code cleaner i would prefer to select these few lines that prefer to select these few lines that prefer to select these few lines that belong to the content block and belong to the content block and belong to the content block and indent them like this this is not indent them like this this is not indent them like this this is not required but it just makes our code required but it just makes our code required but it just makes our code easier to read easier to read easier to read so with these changes that we made in so with these changes that we made in so with these changes that we made in this tutorial when django tries to this tutorial when django tries to this tutorial when django tries to render this page render this page render this page first it will look at base.html so it first it will look at base.html so it first it will look at base.html so it will take all the markup defined in that will take all the markup defined in that will take all the markup defined in that file and then it's going to fill file and then it's going to fill file and then it's going to fill this content block with the markup we this content block with the markup we this content block with the markup we have defined here have defined here have defined here now if we go back to our browser now if we go back to our browser now if we go back to our browser and and and refresh this page we're going to see refresh this page we're going to see refresh this page we're going to see something a little bit better so refresh something a little bit better so refresh something a little bit better so refresh you can see the fonts are changed and you can see the fonts are changed and you can see the fonts are changed and there is a little bit more space in there is a little bit more space in there is a little bit more space in between the bullet points between the bullet points between the bullet points now you're ready to replace each bullet now you're ready to replace each bullet now you're ready to replace each bullet point with a bootstrap card and that's point with a bootstrap card and that's point with a bootstrap card and that's what i'm going to show you next in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you in this tutorial i'm going to show you how to display these beautiful cards on how to display these beautiful cards on how to display these beautiful cards on our products page now note that this our products page now note that this our products page now note that this page is responsive so if you view it on page is responsive so if you view it on page is responsive so if you view it on a small mobile device we're going to a small mobile device we're going to a small mobile device we're going to have one card on each row have one card on each row have one card on each row like this like this like this and if you view this on a bigger screen and if you view this on a bigger screen and if you view this on a bigger screen we're going to have more columns or more we're going to have more columns or more we're going to have more columns or more cards on each row so let me show you how cards on each row so let me show you how cards on each row so let me show you how to build this to build this to build this first head over to get bootstrap.com first head over to get bootstrap.com first head over to get bootstrap.com click on the documentation click on the documentation click on the documentation here on the left side you can see a link here on the left side you can see a link here on the left side you can see a link called components called components called components on this page you can see all the on this page you can see all the on this page you can see all the components that are defined in bootstrap components that are defined in bootstrap components that are defined in bootstrap these are the components that we can add these are the components that we can add these are the components that we can add to our web pages to make them beautiful to our web pages to make them beautiful to our web pages to make them beautiful and modern and modern and modern so the component that we're going to use so the component that we're going to use so the component that we're going to use is called a card over here you can see over here you can see over here you can see an example of a card an example of a card an example of a card and right below that you can see the and right below that you can see the and right below that you can see the markup that we need to use to render markup that we need to use to render markup that we need to use to render something like this something like this something like this so so so let me resize this screen okay on the let me resize this screen okay on the let me resize this screen okay on the top right corner we have this button top right corner we have this button top right corner we have this button copy this markup copy this markup copy this markup now back to index.html now back to index.html now back to index.html instead of rendering a ul and a bunch of instead of rendering a ul and a bunch of instead of rendering a ul and a bunch of lis we want to render a bunch of divs lis we want to render a bunch of divs lis we want to render a bunch of divs because with ul and li we'll get bullet because with ul and li we'll get bullet because with ul and li we'll get bullet points but we don't want to display points but we don't want to display points but we don't want to display bullet points here bullet points here bullet points here so so so right below the h1 tag right below the h1 tag right below the h1 tag type out div dot row and then press tab type out div dot row and then press tab type out div dot row and then press tab so this creates a div with the class row so this creates a div with the class row so this creates a div with the class row now in this row we want to repeat now in this row we want to repeat now in this row we want to repeat multiple columns so type out div multiple columns so type out div multiple columns so type out div dot dot dot call as in short for column and then call as in short for column and then call as in short for column and then press tab press tab press tab so we use this divs to create a layout so we use this divs to create a layout so we use this divs to create a layout like this we have multiple columns in a like this we have multiple columns in a like this we have multiple columns in a row row row okay okay okay now inside of a column now inside of a column now inside of a column we want to render a card so now we we want to render a card so now we we want to render a card so now we should paste the markup for rendering a should paste the markup for rendering a should paste the markup for rendering a bootstrap card bootstrap card bootstrap card so paste that here so paste that here so paste that here now we can see our code looks a little now we can see our code looks a little now we can see our code looks a little bit ugly because it's not indented bit ugly because it's not indented bit ugly because it's not indented properly so on the top go to the code properly so on the top go to the code properly so on the top go to the code menu menu menu here we have this item reformat code and here we have this item reformat code and here we have this item reformat code and look at the shortcut that is associated look at the shortcut that is associated look at the shortcut that is associated with this command so let's click that with this command so let's click that with this command so let's click that now our code is beautifully formatted now our code is beautifully formatted now our code is beautifully formatted and it's easier to read and modify and it's easier to read and modify and it's easier to read and modify so we have a row inside this row we have so we have a row inside this row we have so we have a row inside this row we have a column and inside this column we have a column and inside this column we have a column and inside this column we have a card a card a card now we're going to take our for loop and now we're going to take our for loop and now we're going to take our for loop and put it above this column put it above this column put it above this column so for each product we want to render a so for each product we want to render a so for each product we want to render a column column column so scroll down so scroll down so scroll down and and and grab this line of code cut it grab this line of code cut it grab this line of code cut it and then and then and then paste it right above paste it right above paste it right above this column this column this column now we should close this for loop so now we should close this for loop so now we should close this for loop so let's collapse this div below it let's collapse this div below it let's collapse this div below it okay now right after this div we want to okay now right after this div we want to okay now right after this div we want to add a template tag add a template tag add a template tag and type out and four and type out and four and type out and four with these changes we don't need the with these changes we don't need the with these changes we don't need the code from before we don't need the ul code from before we don't need the ul code from before we don't need the ul and li tags so let's delete all of these and li tags so let's delete all of these and li tags so let's delete all of these so this is the final result so this is the final result so this is the final result inside the content block we should have inside the content block we should have inside the content block we should have these tags these tags these tags we have an h1 on the top for the heading we have an h1 on the top for the heading we have an h1 on the top for the heading below that we have a row below that we have a row below that we have a row then we have our for loop and in each then we have our for loop and in each then we have our for loop and in each iteration we render a column so let's iteration we render a column so let's iteration we render a column so let's also indent this line to go inside the also indent this line to go inside the also indent this line to go inside the for loop that's better and finally we for loop that's better and finally we for loop that's better and finally we close our for loop and after that we close our for loop and after that we close our for loop and after that we close our row close our row close our row with this change if we go back to the with this change if we go back to the with this change if we go back to the browser browser browser and refresh and refresh and refresh we get something like this we're we get something like this we're we get something like this we're basically repeating all that static or basically repeating all that static or basically repeating all that static or fixed markup from bootstrap over here fixed markup from bootstrap over here fixed markup from bootstrap over here so we're not rendering the actual name so we're not rendering the actual name so we're not rendering the actual name or the image of each product but that is or the image of each product but that is or the image of each product but that is a very easy fix a very easy fix a very easy fix so back to our markup let's expand this so back to our markup let's expand this so back to our markup let's expand this column column column so here's our card so here's our card so here's our card inside this card we have an image on inside this card we have an image on inside this card we have an image on line nine look at the source attribute line nine look at the source attribute line nine look at the source attribute of this image of this image of this image we need to change this we need to change this we need to change this and dynamically render the image url and dynamically render the image url and dynamically render the image url attribute of each product so let's attribute of each product so let's attribute of each product so let's delete this delete this delete this and inside the quotes we add double and inside the quotes we add double and inside the quotes we add double curly braces to render some value we curly braces to render some value we curly braces to render some value we want to render product dot image want to render product dot image want to render product dot image underline url underline url underline url like this like this like this now over here on line 11 we have this now over here on line 11 we have this now over here on line 11 we have this text card title we want to replace this text card title we want to replace this text card title we want to replace this with the name of each product so delete with the name of each product so delete with the name of each product so delete double credit braces and we add product double credit braces and we add product double credit braces and we add product dot name dot name dot name next we need to replace this text next we need to replace this text next we need to replace this text with the price of each product so delete with the price of each product so delete with the price of each product so delete here we have a paragraph tag inside this here we have a paragraph tag inside this here we have a paragraph tag inside this tag we add double curly braces to render tag we add double curly braces to render tag we add double curly braces to render product dot price and just before these product dot price and just before these product dot price and just before these braces we want to add a dollar sign braces we want to add a dollar sign braces we want to add a dollar sign and the last change and the last change and the last change is the label for this button is the label for this button is the label for this button it's called go somewhere we want to it's called go somewhere we want to it's called go somewhere we want to change that to add to cart change that to add to cart change that to add to cart now back to this page refresh we should now back to this page refresh we should now back to this page refresh we should get something like this beautiful in this tutorial i'm going to show you a in this tutorial i'm going to show you a in this tutorial i'm going to show you a couple of techniques for improving the couple of techniques for improving the couple of techniques for improving the look and feel of this page first we're look and feel of this page first we're look and feel of this page first we're going to add a navigation bar on the top going to add a navigation bar on the top going to add a navigation bar on the top and then we're gonna add some padding and then we're gonna add some padding and then we're gonna add some padding around with elements currently this around with elements currently this around with elements currently this product card is way too close to the product card is way too close to the product card is way too close to the left side of the screen so we should add left side of the screen so we should add left side of the screen so we should add some padding to let this page breathe some padding to let this page breathe some padding to let this page breathe now to add a navigation bar now to add a navigation bar now to add a navigation bar once again we go to the bootstrap once again we go to the bootstrap once again we go to the bootstrap website look at the documentation for website look at the documentation for website look at the documentation for the navbar component so here's the the navbar component so here's the the navbar component so here's the navbar navbar navbar now if you scroll down now if you scroll down now if you scroll down you can see a typical nav bar so we can you can see a typical nav bar so we can you can see a typical nav bar so we can have these links we could have a drop have these links we could have a drop have these links we could have a drop down we could have a search bar now this down we could have a search bar now this down we could have a search bar now this looks a little bit clunky because i've looks a little bit clunky because i've looks a little bit clunky because i've resized the screen so it doesn't look resized the screen so it doesn't look resized the screen so it doesn't look pretty but below that you can see pretty but below that you can see pretty but below that you can see another another another simple navigation bar with only the simple navigation bar with only the simple navigation bar with only the brand or the name of the application brand or the name of the application brand or the name of the application so over here we have the markup to so over here we have the markup to so over here we have the markup to render this navigation bar so let's go render this navigation bar so let's go render this navigation bar so let's go ahead and copy this ahead and copy this ahead and copy this now back to pycharm where should we add now back to pycharm where should we add now back to pycharm where should we add this markup this markup this markup we should add it to base.html because we should add it to base.html because we should add it to base.html because this is supposed to be a base template this is supposed to be a base template this is supposed to be a base template for all pages in our application for all pages in our application for all pages in our application so so so here's the opening body tag right below here's the opening body tag right below here's the opening body tag right below this body tag we want to paste the this body tag we want to paste the this body tag we want to paste the markup for rendering a navigation bar markup for rendering a navigation bar markup for rendering a navigation bar now the code is not formatted properly now the code is not formatted properly now the code is not formatted properly it looks clunky so once again go to the it looks clunky so once again go to the it looks clunky so once again go to the code menu and then reformat code as you code menu and then reformat code as you code menu and then reformat code as you can see the shortcut for mac is alt can see the shortcut for mac is alt can see the shortcut for mac is alt command and l so i'm going to use a command and l so i'm going to use a command and l so i'm going to use a shortcut here shortcut here shortcut here there you go that is better there you go that is better there you go that is better so here's our navigation bar so here's our navigation bar so here's our navigation bar now let's change this text from navbar now let's change this text from navbar now let's change this text from navbar to to to pi shop that's the name of our pi shop that's the name of our pi shop that's the name of our application right application right application right now back to the browser now back to the browser now back to the browser let's refresh this page we have this let's refresh this page we have this let's refresh this page we have this navigation bar on the top let's go back navigation bar on the top let's go back navigation bar on the top let's go back to pycharm and make a slight change in to pycharm and make a slight change in to pycharm and make a slight change in the structure of our application the structure of our application the structure of our application so here in the products app we created so here in the products app we created so here in the products app we created the templates folder and in this folder the templates folder and in this folder the templates folder and in this folder currently we have two templates the base currently we have two templates the base currently we have two templates the base template for our application and the template for our application and the template for our application and the template for the products page the template for the products page the template for the products page the problem with this structure is that this problem with this structure is that this problem with this structure is that this base html is not reusable because we base html is not reusable because we base html is not reusable because we have added it inside the template of the have added it inside the template of the have added it inside the template of the products app what if in the future we products app what if in the future we products app what if in the future we want to add another app to this project want to add another app to this project want to add another app to this project we don't want to recreate this base.html we don't want to recreate this base.html we don't want to recreate this base.html in every app that just doesn't make in every app that just doesn't make in every app that just doesn't make sense so we want to reuse this across sense so we want to reuse this across sense so we want to reuse this across multiple apps and that's why we need to multiple apps and that's why we need to multiple apps and that's why we need to move this outside of this folder and put move this outside of this folder and put move this outside of this folder and put it somewhere central so it somewhere central so it somewhere central so in the root of our project in the root of our project in the root of our project here we need to add a new folder called here we need to add a new folder called here we need to add a new folder called templates so right click the project and templates so right click the project and templates so right click the project and add add add a new directory a new directory a new directory called templates called templates called templates now we want to go back to the products now we want to go back to the products now we want to go back to the products app app app inside the templates folder inside the templates folder inside the templates folder we drag this base.html file and drop it we drag this base.html file and drop it we drag this base.html file and drop it into the main templates folder into the main templates folder into the main templates folder okay good now our base template is somewhere good now our base template is somewhere good now our base template is somewhere central so we can reuse it in multiple central so we can reuse it in multiple central so we can reuse it in multiple apps apps apps however if we go back to the browser and however if we go back to the browser and however if we go back to the browser and refresh this page we get this error refresh this page we get this error refresh this page we get this error template does not exist template does not exist template does not exist if you scroll down you can see why we if you scroll down you can see why we if you scroll down you can see why we get this error get this error get this error so over here you can see this red line so over here you can see this red line so over here you can see this red line let me zoom in let me zoom in let me zoom in this error happens because django this error happens because django this error happens because django couldn't load couldn't load couldn't load base.html base.html base.html now if you scroll up now if you scroll up now if you scroll up you can see the paths that django you can see the paths that django you can see the paths that django searches for to find this template searches for to find this template searches for to find this template here's the first path here's the first path here's the first path admin slash templates slash base.html so admin slash templates slash base.html so admin slash templates slash base.html so django is looking for this template django is looking for this template django is looking for this template inside the admin app inside the admin app inside the admin app here's the second path aus slash here's the second path aus slash here's the second path aus slash templates slash base.html so django templates slash base.html so django templates slash base.html so django couldn't find it in the admin app it couldn't find it in the admin app it couldn't find it in the admin app it thinks maybe it's in the us app and thinks maybe it's in the us app and thinks maybe it's in the us app and finally here's the last pass products finally here's the last pass products finally here's the last pass products slash templates slash base.html that is slash templates slash base.html that is slash templates slash base.html that is our products app so what is going on our products app so what is going on our products app so what is going on here django is looking for this template here django is looking for this template here django is looking for this template only inside of the installed apps only inside of the installed apps only inside of the installed apps but this templates folder that we but this templates folder that we but this templates folder that we created it's not really part of any apps created it's not really part of any apps created it's not really part of any apps it's just a standalone folder it's just a standalone folder it's just a standalone folder so we need to tell django to look inside so we need to tell django to look inside so we need to tell django to look inside this folder in addition to the installed this folder in addition to the installed this folder in addition to the installed apps and that is very easy apps and that is very easy apps and that is very easy so so so in the main package pi shop in the main package pi shop in the main package pi shop you have seen the settings file before you have seen the settings file before you have seen the settings file before let's have another look here if you let's have another look here if you let's have another look here if you scroll up scroll up scroll up you can see this variable base directory you can see this variable base directory you can see this variable base directory this variable is set to the complete this variable is set to the complete this variable is set to the complete path of where you have stored this path of where you have stored this path of where you have stored this django project on your disk django project on your disk django project on your disk we're going to take this directory and we're going to take this directory and we're going to take this directory and append templates to it append templates to it append templates to it so so so scroll down scroll down scroll down on line 55 you can see the configuration on line 55 you can see the configuration on line 55 you can see the configuration for loading templates for loading templates for loading templates look at the settings we have here the look at the settings we have here the look at the settings we have here the first setting is back end and this is first setting is back end and this is first setting is back end and this is the engine that is used to parse our the engine that is used to parse our the engine that is used to parse our templates so all those template tags as templates so all those template tags as templates so all those template tags as well as the double curly braces this is well as the double curly braces this is well as the double curly braces this is the engine the engine the engine that knows how to interpret those that knows how to interpret those that knows how to interpret those look at the second setting look at the second setting look at the second setting directories this is set to an empty list directories this is set to an empty list directories this is set to an empty list so here we need to reference the so here we need to reference the so here we need to reference the templates folder in this project templates folder in this project templates folder in this project so let's type out os so let's type out os so let's type out os dot path so we're using the path object dot path so we're using the path object dot path so we're using the path object defined in the os or operating system defined in the os or operating system defined in the os or operating system module that is important on the top now module that is important on the top now module that is important on the top now this path object has a method called this path object has a method called this path object has a method called join and with this we can join multiple join and with this we can join multiple join and with this we can join multiple parts of a path parts of a path parts of a path the first part the first part the first part is base underlined is base underlined is base underlined which is the variable that i showed you which is the variable that i showed you which is the variable that i showed you earlier it's set to the complete path of earlier it's set to the complete path of earlier it's set to the complete path of your django project your django project your django project now we want to take this and append now we want to take this and append now we want to take this and append templates to it templates to it templates to it that's all you have to do so back to the that's all you have to do so back to the that's all you have to do so back to the browser let's refresh the page there you browser let's refresh the page there you browser let's refresh the page there you go the problem is fixed so now our base go the problem is fixed so now our base go the problem is fixed so now our base template is somewhere central and we can template is somewhere central and we can template is somewhere central and we can reuse it across multiple apps beautiful reuse it across multiple apps beautiful reuse it across multiple apps beautiful and one last change and one last change and one last change currently as you see these items are so currently as you see these items are so currently as you see these items are so close to the left side of the screen so close to the left side of the screen so close to the left side of the screen so i'm going to add some padding to make i'm going to add some padding to make i'm going to add some padding to make this page breathe and that is very easy this page breathe and that is very easy this page breathe and that is very easy back to pycharm back to pycharm back to pycharm here in our base
